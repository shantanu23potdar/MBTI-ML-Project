                    <h1>    Introduction
</h1>


                        <div class="definition">
                            <p class="title">Who is A Protagonist (ENFJ)?</p>
                            <p>A <dfn>Protagonist (ENFJ)</dfn> is a person with the <a class="link--inline" href="/articles/mind-introverted-vs-extraverted">Extraverted</a>, <a class="link--inline" href="/articles/energy-intuitive-vs-observant">Intuitive</a>, <a class="link--inline" href="/articles/nature-thinking-vs-feeling">Feeling</a>, and <a class="link--inline" href="/articles/tactics-judging-vs-prospecting">Judging</a> personality traits. These warm, forthright types love helping others, and they tend to have strong ideas and values. They back their perspective with the creative energy to achieve their goals.</p>
                        </div>


                        <p>Protagonists (ENFJs) feel called to serve a greater purpose in life. Thoughtful and idealistic, these personality types strive to have a positive impact on other people and the world around them. They rarely shy away from an opportunity to do the right thing, even when doing so is far from easy.</p>
<div class="scene">
    <img alt="Protagonist (ENFJ) personality" src="https://static.neris-assets.com/images/personality-types/scenes/diplomats_Protagonist_ENFJ_introduction.svg" alt="Protagonist (ENFJ) personality">
</div>
<p>Protagonists are born leaders, which explains why these personalities can be found among many notable politicians, coaches, and teachers. Their passion and charisma allow them to inspire others not just in their careers but in every arena of their lives, including their relationships. Few things bring Protagonists a deeper sense of joy and fulfillment than guiding friends and loved ones to grow into their best selves.</p>
<blockquote><p>When the whole world is silent, even one voice becomes powerful.</p><footer>MALALA YOUSAFZAI</footer></blockquote>
<h2><strong>Speaking Up for What’s Right</strong></h2>
<p>Protagonists tend to be vocal about their values, including authenticity and altruism. When something strikes them as unjust or wrong, they speak up. But they rarely come across as brash or pushy, as their sensitivity and insight guide them to speak in ways that resonate with others.</p>
<p>These personality types have an uncanny ability to pick up on people’s underlying motivations and beliefs. At times, they may not even understand how they come to grasp another person’s mind and heart so quickly. These flashes of insight can make Protagonists incredibly persuasive and inspiring communicators.</p>
<div class="description-pullout">Changing people’s minds is no easy task – but if anyone can do it, it’s Protagonists.</div>
<p>Protagonists’ secret weapon is their purity of intent. Generally speaking, they are motivated by a sincere wish to do the right thing rather than a desire to manipulate or have power over other people. Even when they disagree with someone, Protagonists search for common ground. The result is that people with this personality type can communicate with an eloquence and sensitivity that are nearly impossible to ignore – particularly when they speak about matters that are close to their hearts.</p>
<h2><strong>Getting Involved</strong></h2>
<p>When Protagonists care about someone, they want to help solve that person’s problems – sometimes at any cost. The good news is that many people are grateful for Protagonists’ assistance and advice. After all, there’s a reason that these personalities have a reputation for helping others improve their lives.</p>
<div class="description-pullout">Protagonists are genuine, caring people who talk the talk and walk the walk. Nothing makes them happier than motivating other people to do what’s right.</div>
<p>But getting involved in other people’s problems isn’t always a recipe for success. Protagonists tend to have a clear vision of what people can or should do in order to better themselves, but not everyone is ready to make those changes. If Protagonists push too hard, their loved ones may feel resentful or unfairly judged. And while this personality type is known for being insightful, even the wisest Protagonists may sometimes misread a situation or unwittingly give bad advice.</p>
<h2><strong>Leading the Way</strong></h2>
<p>People with this personality type are devoted altruists, ready to face slings and arrows in order to stand up for the people and ideas that they believe in. This strength of conviction bolsters Protagonists’ innate leadership skills, particularly their ability to guide people to work together in service of the greater good.</p>
<p>But their greatest gift might actually be leading by example. In their day-to-day lives, Protagonists reveal how seemingly ordinary situations can be handled with compassion, dedication, and care. For these personalities, even the smallest daily choices and actions – from how they spend their weekend to what they say to a coworker who is struggling – can become an opportunity to lead the way to a brighter future.</p>

    <h1>    Strengths &amp; Weaknesses
</h1>


        <h2>Protagonist (ENFJ) Strengths</h2>
<div class="scene">
<img alt="Protagonist (ENFJ) strengths" src="https://static.neris-assets.com/images/personality-types/scenes/diplomats_Protagonist_ENFJ_strengths.svg" alt="Protagonist (ENFJ) strengths">
</div>
<ul><li><strong>Receptive</strong> – Protagonists have strong opinions, but they’re far from closed-minded. They recognize the importance of allowing others to express themselves fully. Even when Protagonists don’t agree with someone, they recognize that person’s right to voice their truth.</li><li><strong>Reliable</strong> – Few things bother Protagonists more than the prospect of letting down a person or cause that they believe in. People with this personality type can be counted on to see their promises and responsibilities through – even when it’s difficult to do so.</li><li><strong>Passionate</strong> – Protagonists are far from being boring do-gooders. These types brim with interests, and they take great pleasure in pursuing their hobbies – whether that’s hiking, cooking, dancing, growing houseplants, or something else entirely. As a result, they rarely find themselves at a loss for something interesting to do.</li><li><strong>Altruistic</strong> – These personalities are known for harboring a deep desire to be a force for positive change. Protagonists genuinely believe that if they bring people together, they can do a world of good.</li><li><strong>Charismatic</strong> – Determined and inspiring, Protagonists often find their way into leadership roles. Whether they’re captain of their softball team or a leader on the world stage, they rarely lose sight of their main goal: to be of service to others.</li></ul>
<h2>Protagonist (ENFJ) Weaknesses</h2>
<div class="scene">
<img alt="Protagonist (ENFJ) weaknesses" src="https://static.neris-assets.com/images/personality-types/scenes/diplomats_Protagonist_ENFJ_weaknesses.svg" alt="Protagonist (ENFJ) weaknesses">
</div>
<ul><li><strong>Unrealistic</strong> – Many Protagonists put pressure on themselves to right every wrong that they encounter. But no matter how hard these personalities strive, it just isn’t realistic for them to solve all of the world’s problems. If they aren’t careful, they can spread themselves too thin – and be left unable to help anyone.</li><li><strong>Overly Idealistic</strong> – Protagonists tend to have clear ideas about what’s right and what’s wrong. They often think that everyone shares these fundamental principles – or, at least, that everyone <em>should </em>share these principles. So it can come as a genuine shock to Protagonists when people violate their core values, such as truth or justice.</li><li><strong>Condescending</strong> – People with this personality type enjoy teaching others, particularly about the causes and beliefs that matter so much to them. But, at times, Protagonists’ attempts to “enlighten” others may come across as patronizing – not the most effective strategy for persuading other people, unfortunately.</li><li><strong>Intense</strong> – When it comes to self-improvement, Protagonists are rarely short on energy or determination. But they may not recognize that not everyone shares these qualities. At times, Protagonists may push others to make changes that they aren’t ready for – or simply aren’t interested in making in the first place.</li><li><strong>Overly Empathetic</strong> – Compassion is among this personality type’s greatest strengths. But Protagonists have a tendency to take on other people’s problems as their own – a habit that can leave them emotionally and physically exhausted.</li></ul>

    <h1>    Career Paths
</h1>


        <p>When it comes to choosing a career, Protagonists (ENFJs) find fulfillment in doing what they love most – helping other people. And with their creativity and drive, they can find ways to serve and uplift others in nearly any work environment, whether they’re behind a gleaming table in a corporate boardroom or behind the counter at a beloved local coffee shop.</p>
<div class="scene">
<img alt="Protagonist (ENFJ) careers" src="https://static.neris-assets.com/images/personality-types/scenes/diplomats_Protagonist_ENFJ_career_path.svg" alt="Protagonist (ENFJ) careers">
</div>
<div class="description-pullout">People with the Protagonist personality type rarely want for inspiration or opportunity in their search for meaningful work.</div>
<h2>Earning Their Place</h2>
<p>Thanks to their emotional intelligence and social skills, Protagonists can excel in nearly any people-oriented field, such as human resources, event management, recruiting, or public relations. That said, they tend to feel especially motivated in positions where they can guide others to learn, grow, and become more independent. Many people with this personality type gravitate toward careers with an altruistic bent, such as social work, teaching, counseling, coaching, health care, or public interest law.</p>
<div class="description-pullout">Protagonists prove that a desire to serve others can be more than compatible with big ambitions.</div>
<p>Rather than fading into the background, Protagonists are known for their leadership abilities, and they often find themselves in positions of influence. These personalities can be found in public office and at the helm of all sorts of organizations – from nonprofits and religious groups to scrappy start-ups and corporate empires. They may also find themselves in jobs as consultants, advisors, and managers.</p>
<p>Wherever they work, Protagonists rarely lose sight of their core mission: to improve people’s lives. They intuitively pick up on the needs of their clients or customers, and then they draw on their creativity to meet these needs in innovative, unexpected ways. As a result, these types are able to bring sincerity, integrity, and even idealism to jobs in sales, customer service, marketing, advertising, and product development.</p>
<h2>Finding the Deeper Issues</h2>
<p>Focused and driven, people with the Protagonist personality type are always up for a good challenge. That said, certain challenges motivate them more than others. Work that is repetitive, isolated, or otherwise constrained can be frustrating for them. Protagonists want to see the impact they’re having, not to plug away at tasks all on their own.</p>
<div class="description-pullout">In their heart of hearts, Protagonists want to witness the positive effects of their work – to feel and experience the gratitude and appreciation of the people they’ve helped.</div>
<p>Protagonists feel fulfilled and energized by work that allows them to step back and reflect on the big picture. For these types, leaving a positive legacy is a key priority. This needn’t mean something as grand as solving world hunger (although, knowing Protagonists, it certainly could). But most people with this personality type do use their professional energy to resolve at least some of the deeper issues that their customers or colleagues face.</p>
<p>Versatile and insightful, Protagonists bring a wealth of strengths to their careers. At times, they may feel stuck or bored, wishing that their daily tasks could make more of an obvious difference in the world. But with their altruistic, creative spirits, these personalities almost inevitably find ways to use their work – whatever it might be – to contribute to the greater good.</p>

                    <h1>    Introduction
</h1>


                        <div class="definition">
                            <p class="title">Who is A Campaigner (ENFP)?</p>
                            <p>A <dfn>Campaigner (ENFP)</dfn> is someone with the <a class="link--inline" href="/articles/mind-introverted-vs-extraverted">Extraverted</a>, <a class="link--inline" href="/articles/energy-intuitive-vs-observant">Intuitive</a>, <a class="link--inline" href="/articles/nature-thinking-vs-feeling">Feeling</a>, and <a class="link--inline" href="/articles/tactics-judging-vs-prospecting">Prospecting</a> personality traits. These people tend to embrace big ideas and actions that reflect their sense of hope and goodwill toward others. Their vibrant energy can flow in many directions.</p>
                        </div>


                        <blockquote><p>It doesn’t interest me what you do for a living. I want to know what you ache for – and if you dare to dream of meeting your heart’s longing.</p><footer>ORIAH MOUNTAIN DREAMER</footer></blockquote>
<p>Campaigners (ENFPs) are true free spirits – outgoing, openhearted, and open-minded. With their lively, upbeat approach to life, they stand out in any crowd. But even though they can be the life of the party, Campaigners don’t just care about having a good time. These personality types run deep – as does their longing for meaningful, emotional connections with other people.</p>

</div>
<h2><strong>The Magic of Everyday Life</strong></h2>
<p>Friendly and outgoing, Campaigners are devoted to enriching their relationships and their social lives. But beneath their sociable, easygoing exteriors, they have rich, vibrant inner lives as well. Without a healthy dose of imagination, creativity, and curiosity, a Campaigner simply wouldn’t be a Campaigner.</p>
<p>In their unique way, Campaigners can be quite introspective. They can’t help but ponder the deeper meaning and significance of life – even when they should be paying attention to something else. These personalities believe that everything – and everyone – is connected, and they live for the glimmers of insight that they can gain into these connections.</p>
<div class="description-pullout">Campaigners are independent and creative, always on the lookout for the magic and meaning in everyday life.</div>
<p>When something sparks their imagination, Campaigners can show an enthusiasm that is nothing short of infectious. These personalities radiate a positive energy that draws in other people, and Campaigners may find themselves being held up by their peers as a leader or guru. But once the initial bloom of inspiration wears off, Campaigners can struggle with self-discipline and consistency, losing steam on projects that once meant so much to them.</p>
<h2><strong>Seeking Joy</strong></h2>
<p>Campaigners are proof that seeking out life’s joys and pleasures isn’t the same as being shallow. Seemingly in the blink of an eye, people with this personality type can transform from impassioned idealists to carefree figures on the dance floor.</p>
<div class="description-pullout">Campaigner personalities are capable of intense thought and feeling – and also of kicking back and having a good time.</div>
<p>Even in moments of fun, Campaigners want to connect emotionally with others. Few things matter more to these personality types than having genuine, heartfelt conversations with the people they cherish. Campaigners believe that everyone deserves to express their feelings, and their empathy and warmth create spaces where even the most timid spirits can feel comfortable opening up.</p>
<p>People with this personality type need to be careful, however. Campaigners’ intuition may lead them to read far too much into other people’s actions and behaviors. Instead of simply asking for an explanation, Campaigners may end up puzzling over someone else’s desires or intentions. This kind of social stress is what keeps harmony-focused Campaigners awake at night.</p>
<p>Campaigners will spend a lot of time exploring different relationships, feelings, and ideas before they find a path for their lives that feels right. But when they finally do find their way, their imagination, empathy, and courage can light up not only their own lives but also the world around them.</p>

    <h1>    Strengths &amp; Weaknesses
</h1>


        <h2><strong>Campaigner (ENFP) Strengths</strong></h2>
<div class="scene">
<img alt="Campaigner (ENFP) strengths" src="https://static.neris-assets.com/images/personality-types/scenes/diplomats_Campaigner_ENFP_strengths.svg" alt="Campaigner (ENFP) strengths">
</div>
<ul><li><strong>Curious</strong> – Campaigners can find beauty and fascination in nearly anything. Imaginative and open-minded, these personalities aren’t afraid to venture beyond their comfort zones in search of new ideas, experiences, and adventures.</li><li><strong>Perceptive</strong> – To people with this personality type, no one is unimportant – which might explain how they can pick up on even the subtlest shifts in another person’s mood or expression. Because they’re so sensitive to other people’s feelings and needs, Campaigners can make full use of their caring, considerate nature.</li><li><strong>Enthusiastic</strong> – When something captures their imagination and inspires them, Campaigners want to share it with anyone who will listen. And they’re just as eager to hear other people’s ideas and opinions – even if those thoughts are wildly different from their own.</li><li><strong>Excellent Communicators</strong> – Campaigners brim with things to say, but they can be caring listeners as well. This gives them a nearly unmatched ability to have positive and enjoyable conversations with all sorts of people – even people who aren’t particularly sociable or agreeable.</li><li><strong>Festive</strong> – Campaigners may live for deep, meaningful conversations, but they can also be spontaneous and lighthearted. These personalities know how to find fun and joy in the present moment – and few things give them more pleasure than sharing their joy with others.</li><li><strong>Good-Natured</strong> – All of these strengths come together to form a person who is warmhearted and approachable, with an altruistic spirit and a friendly disposition. Campaigners strive to get along with pretty much everyone, and their circles of acquaintances and friends often stretch far and wide.</li></ul>
<h2><strong>Campaigner (ENFP) Weaknesses</strong></h2>
<div class="scene">
<img alt="Campaigner (ENFP) weaknesses" src="https://static.neris-assets.com/images/personality-types/scenes/diplomats_Campaigner_ENFP_weaknesses.svg" alt="Campaigner (ENFP) weaknesses">
</div>
<ul><li><strong>People-Pleasing</strong> – Most Campaigners are uncomfortable with the prospect of being disliked. To maintain the peace, they may compromise on things that matter to them or allow other people to treat them poorly. And when they fail to win someone over, they might lose sleep trying to figure out what to do about it.</li><li><strong>Unfocused</strong> – The thrill of a new project – especially one that involves collaborating with other people – can bring out the best in Campaigners. But this personality type is known for having ever-evolving interests, meaning that Campaigners may find it challenging to maintain discipline and focus over the long term.</li><li><strong>Disorganized</strong> – Campaigners’ enthusiasm is legendary, but it doesn’t extend to everything. Specifically, people with this personality type may try to avoid boring, practical matters, such as chores, maintenance, or paperwork. The resulting sense of disorganization can become a major source of stress in their lives.</li><li><strong>Overly Accommodating</strong> – Campaigner personalities feel called to uplift others, and they may find themselves saying yes whenever anyone asks them for guidance or help. But unless they set boundaries, even the most energetic Campaigners can become overcommitted, with too little time and energy to tackle the necessities of their own lives.</li><li><strong>Overly Optimistic</strong> – Optimism can be among this personality type’s key strengths. But Campaigners’ rosy outlook can lead them to make well-intentioned but naive decisions, such as believing people who haven’t earned their trust. This trait can also make it difficult for Campaigners to accept hard but necessary truths – and to share those truths with others.</li><li><strong>Restless </strong>– With their positive, upbeat attitude, Campaigners rarely seem upset or dissatisfied on the outside. But their inner idealism can leave them with a nagging feeling that some major areas of their life just aren’t good enough – whether that’s their work, their home life, or their relationships.</li></ul>

    <h1>    Career Paths
</h1>


        <p>“Maybe I could…fly helicopters <em>and</em> be an oceanographer who writes songs and cooks?” Campaigners (ENFPs) are known for having a wealth of ideas, interests, and hobbies – to the extent that they may struggle to fit everything that they care about into their lives.</p>
<p>It’s no surprise, then, that choosing a career path can leave people with this personality type feeling overwhelmed or scattered. They may feel pulled in multiple directions, uncertain of how to honor their passions and keep their options open while pulling in a steady paycheck.</p>
<div class="scene">
<img alt="Campaigner (ENFP) careers" src="https://static.neris-assets.com/images/personality-types/scenes/diplomats_Campaigner_ENFP_career_path.svg" alt="Campaigner (ENFP) careers">
</div>
<p>The good news? Campaigners can use their boundless curiosity and imagination to propel themselves forward in nearly any profession.</p>
<div class="description-pullout">When selecting a career, Campaigners tend to find that their main issue isn’t a lack of options. It’s that there are just so many fascinating and worthy possibilities to explore.</div>
<h2><strong>What Works for Campaigners</strong></h2>
<p>Campaigners have a way of brightening the world around them – including their workplaces. With the right mindset, these personalities can find pleasure and gratification in nearly any job. They may even welcome the challenge of breaking through a grumpy coworker’s shell, making harried customers smile, or boosting the morale of a less-than-cheerful workplace.</p>
<p>That said, Campaigners are more likely to be fulfilled by work that meets certain criteria. First, they need to believe that what they do on a daily basis aligns with their core values. Second, most people with this personality type feel best in jobs that use – and build on – their talents.</p>
<div class="description-pullout">It can be hard for Campaigners to maintain motivation in a job that doesn’t enable them to help people or create community in some way.</div>
<p>These personality types may feel that something is missing if they take on a career that doesn’t allow them to use and improve their people skills. Campaigners also tend to be most motivated in careers that offer learning opportunities and room for creativity – including the opportunity to experiment with side projects that catch their interest.</p>
<p>This explains why many Campaigners are drawn to careers in nonprofits, public service, counseling, education, customer or public relations, hospitality, media and entertainment, and the service industry. Jobs in social media and communications can be an excellent fit for them as well, allowing them to balance creativity with a sense of human connection. Campaigners may also gravitate toward scientific and technical fields where they can have a positive impact, such as human health and environmental science.</p>
<h2><strong>Letting Creativity Prevail</strong></h2>
<p>For people with this personality type, few things are as demoralizing as a job where every day is the same. Predictability and repetition can make Campaigners feel not only bored but also a little disheartened. Although they benefit from a degree of structure and accountability, they may lose steam in work environments that rely on strict regimentation and hierarchy.</p>
<p>Campaigners crave variety, and they love to ask questions. To maintain motivation, they need to feel as if they’re pushing boundaries and exploring new ideas. Any job that expects them to keep quiet and follow protocol is effectively turning two of Campaigners’ greatest strengths into liabilities.</p>
<p>Fortunately, Campaigners’ irrepressible creativity is an asset in the majority of workplaces. With their enthusiasm and empathy, these personalities can turn each workday into an opportunity to learn something new and make the world just a little better – and they wouldn’t have it any other way.</p>

<p>Yet Campaigners can be tripped up in certain areas of their lives.

                            <p class="title">Who is A Commander (ENTJ)?</p>
                            <p>A <dfn>Commander (ENTJ)</dfn> is someone with the <a class="link--inline" href="/articles/mind-introverted-vs-extraverted">Extraverted</a>, <a class="link--inline" href="/articles/energy-intuitive-vs-observant">Intuitive</a>, <a class="link--inline" href="/articles/nature-thinking-vs-feeling">Thinking</a>, and <a class="link--inline" href="/articles/tactics-judging-vs-prospecting">Judging</a> personality traits. They are decisive people who love momentum and accomplishment. They gather information to construct their creative visions but rarely hesitate for long before acting on them.</p>
                        </div>


                        <blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Commanders are natural-born leaders. People with this personality type embody the gifts of charisma and confidence, and project authority in a way that draws crowds together behind a common goal. However, Commanders are also characterized by an often ruthless level of rationality, using their drive, determination and sharp minds to achieve whatever end they’ve set for themselves. Perhaps it is best that they make up only three percent of the population, lest they overwhelm the more timid and sensitive personality types that make up much of the rest of the world – but we have Commanders to thank for many of the businesses and institutions we take for granted every day.</p>

<h2>Striving for Greatness</h2>

<p>If there’s anything Commanders love, it’s a good challenge, big or small, and they firmly believe that given enough time and resources, they can achieve any goal. This quality makes people with the Commander personality type brilliant entrepreneurs, and their ability to think strategically and hold a long-term focus while executing each step of their plans with determination and precision makes them powerful business leaders. This determination is often a self-fulfilling prophecy, as Commanders push their goals through with sheer willpower where others might give up and move on, and their Extraverted (E) nature means they are likely to push everyone else right along with them, achieving spectacular results in the process.</p>

</div>

<p>At the negotiating table, be it in a corporate environment or buying a car, Commanders are dominant, relentless, and unforgiving. This isn’t because they are coldhearted or vicious per se – it’s more that Commander personalities genuinely enjoy the challenge, the battle of wits, the repartee that comes from this environment, and if the other side can’t keep up, that’s no reason for Commanders to fold on their own core tenet of ultimate victory.</p>

<div class="description-pullout">The underlying thought running through the Commander mind might be something like "I don’t care if you call me an insensitive b*****d, as long as I remain an efficient b*****d".</div>

<p>If there’s anyone Commanders respect, it’s someone who is able to stand up to them intellectually, who is able to act with a precision and quality equal to their own. Commander personalities have a particular skill in recognizing the talents of others, and this helps in both their team-building efforts (since no one, no matter how brilliant, can do everything alone), and to keep Commanders from displaying too much arrogance and condescension. However, they also have a particular skill in calling out others’ failures with a chilling degree of insensitivity, and this is where Commanders really start to run into trouble.</p>

<h2>A Worthy Challenge</h2>

<p>Emotional expression isn’t the strong suit of any Analyst type, but Commanders’ distance from their emotions is especially public, and felt directly by a much broader swath of people. Especially in a professional environment, Commanders will simply crush the sensitivities of those they view as inefficient, incompetent or lazy. To people with the Commander personality type, emotional displays are displays of weakness, and it’s easy to make enemies with this approach – Commanders will do well to remember that they absolutely depend on having a functioning team, not just to achieve their goals, but for their validation and feedback as well, something Commanders are, curiously, very sensitive to.</p>

<p>Commanders are true powerhouses, and they cultivate an image of being larger than life – and often enough they are. They need to remember though, that their stature comes not just from their own actions, but from the actions of the team that props them up, and that it’s important to recognize the contributions, talents and needs, especially from an emotional perspective, of their support network. Even if they have to adopt a "fake it ‘til you make it" mentality, if Commanders are able to combine an emotionally healthy focus alongside their many strengths, they will be rewarded with deep, satisfying relationships and all the challenging victories they can handle.</p>

    <h1>    Strengths &amp; Weaknesses
</h1>


        <h2>Commander Strengths</h2>

<div class="scene">
<img alt="Commander (ENTJ) strengths" src="https://static.neris-assets.com/images/personality-types/scenes/analysts_Commander_ENTJ_strengths.svg" alt="Commander (ENTJ) strengths">
</div>

<ul>
<li><strong>Efficient</strong> – Commanders see inefficiency not just as a problem in its own right, but as something that pulls time and energy away from all their future goals, an elaborate sabotage consisting of irrationality and laziness. People with the Commander personality type will root out such behavior wherever they go.</li>
<li><strong>Energetic</strong> – Rather than finding this process taxing Commanders are energized by it, genuinely enjoying leading their teams forward as they implement their plans and goals.</li>
<li><strong>Self-Confident</strong> – Commanders couldn’t do this if they were plagued by self-doubt – they trust their abilities, make known their opinions, and believe in their capacities as leaders.</li>
<li><strong>Strong-Willed</strong> – Nor do they give up when the going gets tough – Commander personalities strive to achieve their goals, but really nothing is quite as satisfying to them as rising to the challenge of each obstacle in their run to the finish line.</li>
<li><strong>Strategic Thinkers</strong> – Commanders exemplify the difference between moment-to-moment crisis management and navigating the challenges and steps of a bigger plan, and are known for examining every angle of a problem and not just resolving momentary issues, but moving the whole project forward with their solutions.</li>
<li><strong>Charismatic and Inspiring</strong> – These qualities combine to create individuals who are able to inspire and invigorate others, who people actually want to be their leaders, and this in turn helps Commanders to accomplish their often ambitious goals that could never be finished alone.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Commander Weaknesses</h2>

<div class="scene">
<img alt="Commander (ENTJ) weaknesses" src="https://static.neris-assets.com/images/personality-types/scenes/analysts_Commander_ENTJ_weaknesses.svg" alt="Commander (ENTJ) weaknesses">
</div>

<ul>
<li><strong>Stubborn and Dominant</strong> – Sometimes all this confidence and willpower can go too far, and Commanders are all too capable of digging in their heels, trying to win every single debate and pushing their vision, and theirs alone.</li>
<li><strong>Intolerant</strong> – “It’s my way or the highway” – People with the Commander personality type are notoriously unsupportive of any idea that distracts from their primary goals, and even more so of ideas based on emotional considerations. Commanders won’t hesitate a second to make that fact clear to those around them.</li>
<li><strong>Impatient</strong> – Some people need more time to think than others, an intolerable delay to quick-thinking Commanders. They may misinterpret contemplation as stupidity or disinterest in their haste, a terrible mistake for a leader to make.</li>
<li><strong>Arrogant</strong> – Commander personalities respect quick thoughts and firm convictions, their own qualities, and look down on those who don’t match up. This relationship is a challenge for most other personality types who are perhaps not timid in their own right, but will seem so beside overbearing Commanders.</li>
<li><strong>Poor Handling of Emotions</strong> – All this bluster, alongside the assumed supremacy of rationalism, makes Commanders distant from their own emotional expression and sometimes downright scornful of others’. People with this personality type often trample others’ feelings, inadvertently hurting their partners and friends, especially in emotionally charged situations.</li>
<li><strong>Cold and Ruthless</strong> – Their obsession with efficiency and unwavering belief in the merits of rationalism, especially professionally, makes Commanders incredibly insensitive in pursuing their goals, dismissing personal circumstances, sensitivities, and preferences as irrational and irrelevant.</li>
</ul>

    <h1>    Career Paths
</h1>


        <p>It is in the world of careers that Commanders’ boldness and drive are truly at their best. No other personality type is better suited than Commanders to be the respected leader of an organization or team, and no other personality type enjoys it quite so much. Combining their vision, intelligence and determination to push ideas through to completion no matter the obstacles, Commanders are a force to be reckoned with.</p>

<div class="scene">
<img alt="Commander (ENTJ) careers" src="https://static.neris-assets.com/images/personality-types/scenes/analysts_Commander_ENTJ_career_path.svg" alt="Commander (ENTJ) careers">
</div>

<h2>A Singular Vision</h2>

<p>In the world of business, the sometimes overbearing level of self-confidence that Commanders (especially Assertive ones) too often mishandle in their personal relationships is transformed into an admirable authority, keeping people on track and getting things done. Naturally the best careers for people with the Commander personality type make the fullest use of these qualities, and many would describe executive positions and entrepreneurialism to be ideal lines of work – any position high enough that they can clearly see the horizon.</p>

<div class="description-pullout">For Commanders, failure is not an option – they conceive a vision of the future, formulate a strategy to achieve that vision, and execute each step with ruthless precision.</div>

<p>Structure and order are key, and if someone gets sloppy, or holds things back with incompetence, laziness or inefficiency, Commanders will not hesitate to come down, hard. Commander personalities pursue their goals with singular vision, and have strict standards for themselves and others that are designed above all else to be effective. This makes Commanders excellent corporate strategists, and their objectivity and clarity of thought make them respected lawyers and judges.</p>

<p>None of this could work if no one could understand what Commanders were thinking, and they have the good fortune of being clear and concise communicators, especially in person, making business administration a comfortable fit – so long as their tasks don’t stray too far into routine maintenance and upkeep. Commanders also have a thirst for knowledge, and they aren’t afraid to use a principle once they’ve grasped its underlying mechanisms. Combining this with their leadership makes Commanders trying, but effective, university professors.</p>

<h2>Great Expectations</h2>

<p>The only problem is, it takes time for Commanders’ skills to be recognized, and stagnating as low-level employees will have them bouncing off the walls and deeply unhappy. People with the Commander personality type crave leadership and responsibility, growth and opportunity, and genuinely enjoy managing others to get a job done. Commanders are visionaries and leaders, not grunts or day-to-day administrators. Getting that to be recognized is not always easy, but Commanders are probably up to the task.</p>

    <h1>    Conclusion
</h1>


        <p>Armed with a powerful intellect and strategic thinking, Commanders can overcome or outmaneuver obstacles that seem unbeatable to most. At the same time, their many quirks, such as often unconstrained rationalism, lead to many misunderstandings. Those misunderstandings end here. What you have read so far is just an introduction – we have a great deal more to tell you about the Commander personality type.</p>

<p>At some point in reading through your results, you probably hit a tipping point. You went from trademark Commander skepticism to “huh...” to “wait, what?” You may even be a little uncomfortable because you are really not used to being understood, even by the people you’re closest to.</p>

<p>Chances are, you’ve accepted that as part of who you are, and maybe even grown proud of it. But embracing that disconnection isn’t a requirement for Commanders. It’s a misused defense mechanism, leading you down a lonely, inefficient path – gaining insight into yourself and others is so much more rewarding.</p>

<div class="scene">
<img alt="Commander (ENTJ) personality" src="https://static.neris-assets.com/images/personality-types/scenes/analysts_Commander_ENTJ_conclusion.svg">
</div>

<p>This is no date-of-birth gimmick, and no, we did not spy on you – rather, we’ve spent years studying Commanders’ life stories, experiences, and patterns in hundreds of our surveys. Step by step, insight by insight, we discovered how those who share your qualities and outlook have overcome the challenges they’ve faced. You are a unique individual, but you are not alone in this. It’s wise to learn from others’ experiences – and we’d really like to share those insights with you.</p>

<p>As you move forward into the e-books and interactive courses we offer, we go much deeper into the Commander mind. We answer not just “what”, but “why?”, “how?” and “what if?” Why do you act the way you do? How do you find motivation and inspiration? What if you moved beyond fear to pursue what you secretly want to achieve in life?</p>

<p>We can show you how to use your strengths to unlock your exceptional potential and avoid common pitfalls, while also staying true to who you are – after all, that’s the point. To see how you can grow to be the person you know you’re capable of being, in ways that finally feel right – read on, Commander.</p>

                            <p>A <dfn>Debater (ENTP)</dfn> is a person with the <a class="link--inline" href="/articles/mind-introverted-vs-extraverted">Extraverted</a>, <a class="link--inline" href="/articles/energy-intuitive-vs-observant">Intuitive</a>, <a class="link--inline" href="/articles/nature-thinking-vs-feeling">Thinking</a>, and <a class="link--inline" href="/articles/tactics-judging-vs-prospecting">Prospecting</a> personality traits. They tend to be bold and creative, deconstructing and rebuilding ideas with great mental agility. They pursue their goals vigorously despite any resistance they might encounter.</p>
                        </div>


                        <p>Quick-witted and audacious, Debaters aren’t afraid to disagree with the status quo. In fact, they’re not afraid to disagree with pretty much anything or anyone. Few things light up people with this personality type more than a bit of verbal sparring – and if the conversation veers into controversial terrain, so much the better.</p>

<p>It would be a mistake, though, to think of Debaters as disagreeable or mean-spirited. Instead, people with this personality type are knowledgeable and curious, with a playful sense of humor, and they can be incredibly entertaining. They simply have an offbeat, contrarian idea of fun – one that involves a healthy dose of spirited debate.</p>

<div class="description-pullout">Debaters are the ultimate devil’s advocates, thriving on the process of shredding arguments and beliefs and letting the ribbons drift in the wind for all to see.</div>

<h2>Breaking the Rules</h2>

<p>Debaters are known for their rebellious streak. For this personality type, no belief is too sacred to be questioned, no idea is too fundamental to be scrutinized, and no rule is too important to be broken, or at least thoroughly tested. Sometimes Debaters even rebel against their <em>own</em> beliefs by arguing the opposing viewpoint – just to see how the world looks from the other side.</p>

<p>As Debaters see it, most people are too ready to do as they’re told and blindly conform to social norms, pressures, and standards. Debaters enjoy the mental exercise of questioning the prevailing mode of thought, and they take a certain pleasure in uncovering the value of underdogs and outliers. Their active minds can’t help but rethink the things that everyone else takes for granted and push them in clever new directions.</p>

<div class="description-pullout">For many Debaters, one of life’s greatest challenges is to translate their wide-ranging intellectual energy into real-world achievements and contributions.</div>

<p>While Debater personalities love to brainstorm and think big, they tend to avoid getting caught doing the “grunt work” of implementing their ideas. To some extent, this makes sense – Debaters have far too many thoughts and suggestions to keep track of them all, let alone turn them into reality. But unless Debaters develop the willingness to identify and actually follow through on their priorities, they may struggle to harness their full potential.</p>

<h2>The Cost of Contrarianism</h2>

<p>Debaters’ capacity for debate is legendary, but that doesn’t mean that it’s always helpful. When they openly question their boss in a meeting or pick apart everything their significant other says, Debaters may think that they’re being champions of rationality and logic. But they may also be doing their chances of success and happiness more harm than good.</p>

<p>Not every occasion calls for this personality type’s default contrarianism, and most people can only stand to have their beliefs questioned and their feelings brushed aside for so long. As a result, Debaters may find that their quarrelsome fun burns many bridges, often inadvertently. Debaters are respected for their vision, confidence, knowledge, and keen sense of humor – but unless they cultivate a bit of sensitivity, they may struggle to maintain deeper relationships or even to achieve their professional goals.</p>

<div class="description-pullout">Many Debaters find that a more compassionate approach is worth exploring as they strive to build solid relationships.</div>

<p>With time, many Debaters realize that their ideal life involves other people and that spending too much energy on “winning” arguments ultimately means robbing themselves of the support that they need to get where they want to be in life. The good news is that people with this personality type will never lose their sharply nonconformist edge. They can simply use their cognitive flexibility to understand and explore other people’s perspectives, recognizing the value of consideration and compromise alongside logic and progress.</p>

    <h1>    Strengths &amp; Weaknesses
</h1>


        <h2>Debater Strengths</h2>

<div class="scene">
<img alt="Debater (ENTP) strengths" src="https://static.neris-assets.com/images/personality-types/scenes/analysts_Debater_ENTP_strengths.svg">
</div>

<ul>
<li><strong>Knowledgeable</strong> – Debaters rarely pass up a good opportunity to learn something new, especially abstract concepts. This information isn’t usually absorbed for any planned purpose as with dedicated studying, people with the Debater personality type just find it fascinating.</li>
<li><strong>Quick Thinkers</strong> – Debaters have tremendously flexible minds, and are able to shift from idea to idea without effort, drawing on their accumulated knowledge to prove their points, or their opponents’, as they see fit.</li>
<li><strong>Original</strong> – Having little attachment to tradition, Debater personalities are able to discard existing systems and methods and pull together disparate ideas from their extensive knowledge base, with a little raw creativity to hold them together, to formulate bold new ideas. If presented with chronic, systemic problems and given rein to solve them, Debaters respond with unabashed glee.</li>
<li><strong>Excellent Brainstormers</strong> – Nothing is quite as enjoyable to Debaters as analyzing problems from every angle to find the best solutions. Combining their knowledge and originality to splay out every aspect of the subject at hand, rejecting without remorse options that don’t work and presenting ever more possibilities, Debaters are irreplaceable in brainstorming sessions.</li>
<li><strong>Charismatic</strong> – People with the Debater personality type have a way with words and wit that others find intriguing. Their confidence, quick thought and ability to connect disparate ideas in novel ways create a style of communication that is charming, even entertaining, and informative at the same time.</li>
<li><strong>Energetic</strong> – When given a chance to combine these traits to examine an interesting problem, Debaters can be truly impressive in their enthusiasm and energy, having no qualms with putting in long days and nights to find a solution.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Debater Weaknesses</h2>

<div class="scene">
<img alt="Debater (ENTP) weaknesses" src="https://static.neris-assets.com/images/personality-types/scenes/analysts_Debater_ENTP_weaknesses.svg">
</div>

<ul>
<li><strong>Very Argumentative</strong> – If there’s anything Debaters enjoy, it’s the mental exercise of debating an idea, and nothing is sacred. More consensus-oriented personality types rarely appreciate the vigor with which Debater personalities tear down their beliefs and methods, leading to a great deal of tension.</li>
<li><strong>Insensitive</strong> – Being so rational, Debaters often misjudge others feelings and push their debates well past others’ tolerance levels. People with this personality type don’t really consider emotional points to be valid in such debates either, which magnifies the issue tremendously.</li>
<li><strong>Intolerant</strong> – Unless people are able to back up their ideas in a round of mental sparring, Debaters are likely to dismiss not just the ideas but the people themselves. Either a suggestion can stand up to rational scrutiny or it’s not worth bothering with.</li>
<li><strong>Can Find It Difficult to Focus</strong> – The same flexibility that allows Debaters to come up with such original plans and ideas makes them readapt perfectly good ones far too often, or to even drop them entirely as the initial excitement wanes and newer thoughts come along. Boredom comes too easily for Debaters, and fresh thoughts are the solution, though not always a helpful one.</li>
<li><strong>Dislike Practical Matters</strong> – Debaters are interested in what could be – malleable concepts like ideas and plans that can be adapted and debated. When it comes to hard details and day-to-day execution where creative flair isn’t just unnecessary but actually counter-productive, Debater personalities lose interest, often with the consequence of their plans never seeing the light of day.</li>

    <h1>    Career Paths
</h1>


        <p>In the world of careers, Debaters have the benefit of being naturally engaged and interested in being productive and helpful. But rather than the sort of people-oriented helpfulness that Diplomat personality types bring to the table, Debater personalities are focused on developing solutions to interesting and diverse technical and intellectual problems. Debaters are a versatile personality type, and while it may take time for them to get to a point where they can fully utilize their skillset and qualities, they are likely to find that those qualities translate well into pretty much any career that so much as piques their interest.</p>

<div class="description-pullout">If there’s anything Debaters love, it’s flexing their mental muscles, and any environment that lets them devise new approaches, new ideas and new projects, that allows them to push the limits of their creativity, will benefit strongly from what Debaters bring to the table.</div>

<p>Not every career allows this level of unbridled brainpower, but there are those that demand nothing but: entrepreneurship, engineering, even acting and photography. So long as Debaters are honest with themselves about their strengths and weaknesses, they can thrive in most any career that is in need of a new line of thinking.</p>

<div class="scene">
<img alt="Debater (ENTP) careers" src="https://static.neris-assets.com/images/personality-types/scenes/analysts_Debater_ENTP_career_path.svg">
</div>

<h2>The Gift of Curiosity</h2>

<p>All this intellectual power can be intimidating, but unlike their Introverted (I) cousins, people with the Debater personality type have the added benefit of being excellent communicators, in the written word but especially in face-to-face conversation. Though they dislike the constraints of managing others (and of being managed), this social adaptability allows Debaters to be natural leaders, showing the way forward and inspiring others with sound logic and intellectual prowess. While others may object to these plans with emotional considerations or general resistance to change, things Debaters place little value in, these competing comments are usually outmaneuvered by Debater personalities’ deft arguments and subtly shifting goals.</p>

<p>The best careers reward intellectual competency and curiosity, allowing Debaters to utilize their never-ending flow of ideas productively by affording a degree of spontaneity in how they engage their intellectual pursuits. People with the Debater personality type value knowledge, rational thought and insight very highly, and they make brilliant lawyers, psychologists, systems analysts and scientists. It’s even possible for Debaters to thrive as sales representatives, as they rationalize purchase decisions that may otherwise seem discretionary – so long as their managers know to give them the space they need to work their magic.</p>

<h2>An Independent Spirit</h2>

<p>Really it all comes down to a sense of personal freedom, for Debaters to know that they are allowed to apply themselves fully to understanding and solving the problems that interest them, without getting bogged down by social politics and trying to figure out what makes other people “tick”. Routine, structure and formal rules all feel like unnecessary hindrances to Debaters, and they may find that their best careers yet allow them to engage their intellectual pursuits on their own terms, as freelance consultants or software engineers.</p>

<p>The key for Debaters is to have the patience to get to a position that allows for these freedoms, to be in an environment long enough that not just their colleagues, but their managers and, in time, their subordinates, recognize what it is that they bring to the table. Debaters have exceptional qualities – it’s quantifying their achievements and skills that presents the biggest challenge. But once they’ve got their foot in the door, once they’ve got a willing ear higher in the hierarchy, the sky’s the limit.</p>

    <h1>    Conclusion
</h1>


        <p>Armed with a powerful intellect and vivid imagination, Debaters can overcome or outmaneuver obstacles that seem unbeatable to most. At the same time, their many quirks, such as often unconstrained rationalism, lead to many misunderstandings. Those misunderstandings end here. What you have read so far is just an introduction – we have a great deal more to tell you about the Debater personality type.</p>

<p>At some point in reading through your results, you probably hit a tipping point. You went from trademark Debater skepticism to “huh...” to “wait, what?” You may even be a little uncomfortable because you are really not used to being understood, even by the people you’re closest to.</p>

<p>Chances are, you’ve accepted that as part of who you are, and maybe even grown proud of it. But embracing that disconnection isn’t a requirement for Debaters. It’s a misused defense mechanism, leading you down a lonely, inefficient path – gaining insight into yourself and others is so much more rewarding.</p>

<div class="scene">

</div>

<p>This is no date-of-birth gimmick, and no, we did not spy on you – rather, we’ve spent years studying Debaters’ life stories, experiences, and patterns in hundreds of our surveys. Step by step, insight by insight, we discovered how those who share your qualities and outlook have overcome the challenges they’ve faced. You are a unique individual, but you are not alone in this. It’s wise to learn from others’ experiences – and we’d really like to share those insights with you.</p>

<p>As you move forward into the e-books and interactive courses we offer, we go much deeper into the Debater mind. We answer not just “what”, but “why?”, “how?” and “what if?” Why do you act the way you do? How do you find motivation and inspiration? What if you moved beyond fear to pursue what you secretly want to achieve in life?</p>

<p>We can show you how to use your strengths to unlock your exceptional potential and avoid common pitfalls, while also staying true to who you are – after all, that’s the point. To see how you can grow to be the person you know you’re capable of being, in ways that finally feel right – read on, Debater.</p>

</h1>


                        <div class="definition">
                            <p class="title">Who is A Consul (ESFJ)?</p>
                            <p>A <dfn>Consul (ESFJ)</dfn> is a person with the <a class="link--inline" href="/articles/mind-introverted-vs-extraverted">Extraverted</a>, <a class="link--inline" href="/articles/energy-intuitive-vs-observant">Observant</a>, <a class="link--inline" href="/articles/nature-thinking-vs-feeling">Feeling</a>, and <a class="link--inline" href="/articles/tactics-judging-vs-prospecting">Judging</a> personality traits. They are attentive and people-focused, and they enjoy taking part in their social community. Their achievements are guided by decisive values, and they willingly offer guidance to others.</p>
                        </div>


                        <blockquote>
    <p>Encourage, lift, and strengthen one another. For the positive energy spread to one will be felt by us all.</p>
    <footer>Deborah Day</footer>
</blockquote>

<p>For Consuls, life is sweetest when it’s shared with others. People with this personality type form the bedrock of many communities, opening their homes – and their hearts – to friends, loved ones, and neighbors.</p>

<p>This doesn’t mean that Consuls like everyone, or that they’re saints. But Consuls do believe in the power of hospitality and good manners, and they tend to feel a sense of duty to those around them. Generous and reliable, people with this personality type often take it upon themselves – in ways both large and small – to hold their families and their communities together.</p>

<div class="description-pullout">Consuls have a talent for making the people in their lives feel supported, cared for, and secure.</div>

<h2>The Beauty of a Responsible Life</h2>

<p>Consuls are altruists. They take seriously their responsibilities to give back, serve others, and do the right thing.</p>

<p>And Consuls believe that there <em>is</em> a clear right thing to do in nearly every situation. While some personality types adopt a more lenient, live-and-let-live attitude, Consuls may find it difficult not to judge when someone takes a path that strikes them as misguided. As a result, Consuls often struggle to accept it when someone – particularly someone they care about – disagrees with them.</p>

<div class="description-pullout">Consuls have a clear moral compass – and it can be nothing short of baffling to them when other people’s actions don’t align with it.</div>

<p>With their definite views on right and wrong, Consuls tend to be on the opinionated side. But these opinions aren’t arbitrary – they’re often based on a deep respect for tradition. Consuls know that everything they do affects someone else, and they trust that established laws, protocols, and social norms will help them navigate their everyday lives in a way that is considerate and responsible toward others.</p>

<h2>Building Relationships That Last</h2>

<p>Supportive and outgoing, Consuls can always be spotted at a party – they’re the ones fluttering around making sure that everyone else is having a good time! But make no mistake: Consuls don’t just breeze through other people’s lives. Loyal to the core, they build lasting relationships, and they can be counted on to show up whenever a helping hand – or a listening ear – is needed.</p>

<div class="description-pullout">Consuls rarely miss a birthday or holiday. Devoted to their relationships, they commit even the smallest details of their friends’ and loved ones’ lives to memory.</div>

<p>With their love of order and structure, Consuls prefer planned events to open-ended activities or spontaneous get-togethers – and they’re happy to host in order to ensure that everything goes smoothly. People with this personality type put a great deal of energy into making other people feel special and celebrated, and they may take it personally when someone doesn’t seem to appreciate their efforts.</p>

<p>For many people with the Consul personality type, one of life’s greatest challenges is accepting that they can’t control anyone else’s thoughts or behavior – not even those who are nearest and dearest to them. Fortunately, Consuls can find peace and fulfillment by focusing on what they do best: setting an example of care, consideration, and responsibility – and bringing people together in the process.</p>

<li><strong>Strong Practical Skills</strong> – Consuls are excellent managers of day-to-day tasks and routine maintenance, enjoying making sure that those who are close to them are well cared for.</li>
<li><strong>Strong Sense of Duty</strong> – People with the Consul personality type have a strong sense of responsibility and strive to meet their obligations, though this may sometimes be more from a sense of social expectations than intrinsic drive.</li>
<li><strong>Very Loyal</strong> – Valuing stability and security very highly, Consuls are eager to preserve the status quo, which makes them extremely loyal and trustworthy partners and employees. Consuls are true pillars of any groups they belong to – whether it is their family or a community club, people with this personality type can always be relied upon.</li>
<li><strong>Sensitive and Warm</strong> – Helping to ensure that stability, Consul personalities seek harmony and care deeply about other people’s feelings, being careful not to offend or hurt anybody. Consuls are strong team players, and win-win situations are the stuff smiles are made of.</li>
<li><strong>Good at Connecting with Others</strong> – These qualities come together to make Consuls social, comfortable and well-liked. Consul personalities have a strong need to “belong”, and have no problem with small talk or following social cues in order to help them take an active role in their communities.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Consul Weaknesses</h2>

<div class="scene">
<img alt="Consul (ESFJ) weaknesses" src="https://static.neris-assets.com/images/personality-types/scenes/sentinels_Consul_ESFJ_weaknesses.svg" alt="Consul (ESFJ) weaknesses">
</div>

<ul>
<li><strong>Worried about Their Social Status</strong> – These Strengths are related to a chief Weakness: Consuls’ preoccupation with social status and influence, which affects many decisions they make, potentially limiting their creativity and open-mindedness.</li>
<li><strong>Inflexible</strong> – Consuls place a lot of importance on what is socially acceptable, and can be very cautious, even critical of anything unconventional or outside the mainstream. People with this personality type may also sometimes push their own beliefs too hard in an effort to establish them as mainstream.</li>
<li><strong>Reluctant to Innovate or Improvise</strong> – Just as they can be critical of others’ “unusual” behavior, Consuls may also be unwilling to step out of their own comfort zones, usually for fear of being (or just appearing) different.</li>
<li><strong>Vulnerable to Criticism</strong> – It can be especially challenging to change these tendencies because Consuls are so conflict-averse. Consul personalities can become very defensive and hurt if someone, especially a person close to them, criticizes their habits, beliefs or traditions.</li>
<li><strong>Often Too Needy</strong> – Consuls need to hear and see a great deal of appreciation. If their efforts go unnoticed, people with the Consul personality type may start fishing for compliments, in an attempt to get reassurance of how much they are valued.</li>
<li><strong>Too Selfless</strong> – The other side of this is that Consuls sometimes try to establish their value with doting attention, something that can quickly overwhelm those who don’t need it, making it ultimately unwelcome. Furthermore, Consuls often neglect their own needs in the process.</li>
</ul>

    <h1>    Career Paths
</h1>


        <p>Because Consuls’ traits are so strongly expressed, leading with practical sense and social vigor, the careers they find most satisfying usually revolve around making the best use of these qualities. Consuls are well-organized, enjoying bringing order and structure to their workplaces, and often work best in environments with clear, predictable hierarchies and tasks. Monotony and routine work are not a challenge for the Consul personality type, as they are happy to do what needs to be done.</p>

<h2>Altruistic Motivations</h2>

<p>Careers as administrators are a natural fit, allowing Consuls to organize not just an environment, but the people in it. Their practical skills combine well with their dependability, making Consul personalities surprisingly good accountants – though they often prefer to be personal accountants, helping people and interacting with them directly, instead of corporate accountants crunching numbers in some back room.</p>

<div class="scene">
<img alt="Consul (ESFJ) careers" src="https://static.neris-assets.com/images/personality-types/scenes/sentinels_Consul_ESFJ_career_path.svg" alt="Consul (ESFJ) careers">
</div>

<p>Purely analytical careers are often too dull for Consuls though – they need human interaction and emotional feedback to be truly satisfied in their line of work. Good listeners and enthusiastic team members, people with the Consul personality type are excellent providers of medical care and social work. Teaching is another great option, as Consuls are comfortable with authority, but are supportive and friendly enough to keep that authority from feeling overbearing.</p>

<div class="description-pullout">Consuls’ best careers all have the additional benefit of providing them with perhaps their most important requirement: to feel appreciated and know they’ve helped someone.</div>

<p>Being as altruistic as they are, Consuls find it hard to be satisfied unless they know they’ve done something valuable for another person. This is often the driving force behind Consuls’ careers and career advancement, and makes religious work and counseling particularly rewarding.</p>

<p>Whatever they choose to do, Consul personalities’ comfort with busy social situations and practical knowledge and skills come together to create people who are not just able to be productive and helpful, but people who genuinely enjoy it.</p>

    <h1>    Conclusion
</h1>


        <p>Few personality types are as practical and caring as Consuls. Known for their social and administrative skills, Consuls are good at creating and maintaining a secure, stable and friendly environment for themselves and their loved ones. Consuls’ dedication is invaluable in many areas, including their own personal growth.</p>

<p>Yet Consuls can be easily tripped up in areas where their kindness and practical approach are more of a liability than an asset. Whether it is finding (or keeping) a partner, learning to relax or improvise, reaching dazzling heights on the career ladder, or managing their workload, Consuls need to put in a conscious effort to develop their weaker traits and additional skills.</p>

                            <p>An <dfn>Entertainer (ESFP)</dfn> is a person with the <a class="link--inline" href="/articles/mind-introverted-vs-extraverted">Extraverted</a>, <a class="link--inline" href="/articles/energy-intuitive-vs-observant">Observant</a>, <a class="link--inline" href="/articles/nature-thinking-vs-feeling">Feeling</a>, and <a class="link--inline" href="/articles/tactics-judging-vs-prospecting">Prospecting</a> personality traits. These people love vibrant experiences, engaging in life eagerly and taking pleasure in discovering the unknown. They can be very social, often encouraging others into shared activities.</p>

<p>If anyone is to be found spontaneously breaking into song and dance, it is the Entertainer personality type. Entertainers get caught up in the excitement of the moment, and want everyone else to feel that way, too. No other personality type is as generous with their time and energy as Entertainers when it comes to encouraging others, and no other personality type does it with such irresistible style.</p>

<h2>Living with Passion</h2>

<p>Entertainers love the spotlight, and all the world’s a stage. Many famous people with the Entertainer personality type are indeed actors, but they love putting on a show for their friends too, chatting with a unique and earthy wit, soaking up attention and making every outing feel a bit like a party. Utterly social, Entertainers enjoy the simplest things, and there’s no greater joy for them than just having fun with a good group of friends.</p>

<p>It’s not just talk either – Entertainers have the strongest aesthetic sense of any personality type. From grooming and outfits to a well-appointed home, Entertainer personalities have an eye for fashion. Knowing what’s attractive the moment they see it, Entertainers aren’t afraid to change their surroundings to reflect their personal style. Entertainers are naturally curious, exploring new designs and styles with ease.</p>

<p>Though it may not always seem like it, Entertainers know that it’s not all about them – they are observant, and very sensitive to others’ emotions. People with this personality type are often the first to help someone talk out a challenging problem, happily providing emotional support and practical advice. However, if the problem is about them, Entertainers are more likely to avoid a conflict altogether than to address it head-on. Entertainers usually love a little drama and passion, but not so much when they are the focus of the criticisms it can bring.</p>

<h2>A Spontaneous Spirit</h2>

<p>The biggest challenge Entertainers face is that they are often so focused on immediate pleasures that they neglect the duties and responsibilities that make those luxuries possible. Complex analysis, repetitive tasks, and matching statistics to real consequences are not easy activities for Entertainers. They’d rather rely on luck or opportunity, or simply ask for help from their extensive circle of friends. It is important for Entertainers to challenge themselves to keep track of long-term things like their retirement plans or sugar intake – there won’t always be someone else around who can help to keep an eye on these things.</p>

<p>Entertainers recognize value and quality, which on its own is a fine trait. In combination with their tendency to be poor planners though, this can cause them to live beyond their means, and credit cards are especially dangerous. More focused on leaping at opportunities than in planning out long-term goals, Entertainers may find that their inattentiveness has made some activities unaffordable.</p>

<div class="description-pullout">There’s nothing that makes Entertainers feel quite as unhappy as realizing that they are boxed in by circumstance, unable to join their friends.</div>

<p>Entertainers are welcome wherever there’s a need for laughter, playfulness, and a volunteer to try something new and fun – and there’s no greater joy for Entertainer personalities than to bring everyone else along for the ride. Entertainers can chat for hours, sometimes about anything but the topic they meant to talk about, and share their loved ones’ emotions through good times and bad. If they can just remember to keep their ducks in a row, they’ll always be ready to dive into all the new and exciting things the world has to offer, friends in tow.</p>

    <h1>    Strengths &amp; Weaknesses
</h1>


        <h2>Entertainer Strengths</h2>

<div class="scene">
<img alt="Entertainer (ESFP) strengths" src="https://static.neris-assets.com/images/personality-types/scenes/explorers_Entertainer_ESFP_strengths.svg" alt="Entertainer (ESFP) strengths">
</div>

<ul>
<li><strong>Bold</strong> – Entertainers aren’t known for holding back. Wanting to experience everything there is to experience, people with the Entertainer personality type don’t mind stepping out of their comfort zones when no one else is willing.</li>
<li><strong>Original</strong> – Traditions and expectations are secondary to Entertainers, if a consideration at all. Entertainer personalities love to experiment with new styles, and constantly find new ways to stick out in the crowd.</li>
<li><strong>Aesthetics and Showmanship</strong> – Not stopping at mere outfits, Entertainers inject artistic creativity into their words and actions, too. Every day is a performance, and Entertainers love to put on a show.</li>
<li><strong>Practical</strong> – To Entertainers, the world is meant to be felt and experienced. Truth is stranger than fiction, and Entertainers prefer to see and do than to wax philosophical about “what-ifs”.</li>
<li><strong>Observant</strong> – With all this focus on the here and now, on doing and acting, it makes sense that Entertainers are naturals when it comes to noticing real, tangible things and changes.</li>
<li><strong>Excellent People Skills</strong> – More so than things though, Entertainers love to pay attention to people. They are talkative, witty, and almost never run out of things to discuss. For people with this personality type, happiness and satisfaction stem from the time they spend with the people they enjoy being with.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Entertainer Weaknesses</h2>

<div class="scene">
<img alt="Entertainer (ESFP) weaknesses" src="https://static.neris-assets.com/images/personality-types/scenes/explorers_Entertainer_ESFP_weaknesses.svg" alt="Entertainer (ESFP) weaknesses">
</div>

<ul>
<li><strong>Sensitive</strong> – Entertainers (especially Turbulent ones) are strongly emotional, and very vulnerable to criticism – they can feel like they’ve been backed into a corner, sometimes reacting badly. This is probably Entertainers’ greatest weakness, because it makes it so hard to address any other weaknesses brought to light.</li>
<li><strong>Conflict-Averse</strong> – Entertainers sometimes ignore and avoid conflict entirely. They tend to say and do what’s needed to get out of such situations, then move on to something more fun.</li>
<li><strong>Easily Bored</strong> – Without constant excitement, Entertainers find ways to create it themselves. Risky behavior, self-indulgence, and the pleasures of the moment over long-term plans are all things Entertainers get into a little too often.</li>
<li><strong>Poor Long-Term Planners</strong> – In fact, Entertainer personalities rarely make detailed plans for the future. To them, things come as they come, and they rarely bother with taking the time to lay out steps and consequences, with the belief that they could change at any moment – even with things that <em>can</em> be planned.</li>
<li><strong>Unfocused </strong> – Anything that requires long-term dedication and focus is a particular challenge for Entertainers. In academics, dense, unchanging subjects like Classic Literature are much more difficult than more dynamic, relatable subjects like psychology. The trick for Entertainers is to find day-to-day joy in broader goals, and to tough it out with those tedious things that must be done.</li>
</ul>

    <h1>    Career Paths
</h1>


        <p>Entertainers have a unique quality that makes them exceptional in some careers, and miserable in others – they mirror the mood around them. When people with the Entertainer personality type are at a party or concert, they reflect that mood, giving them that “party people” image. When their friends are sad, they mirror that with sympathy and empathy. And when there is a crisis, Entertainers adapt as well, matching the intensity of the situation.</p>

<h2>Seeking New Challenges</h2>

<p>As a result, just about any career that focuses on working with others is a good fit, and is even essential for Entertainers to be happy and productive. Entertainer personalities are natural event planners, sales representatives, trip planners, and tour guides, as each of these creates a sense of excitement, stimulation, and novelty between them and their customers.

<p>Entertainers genuinely enjoy spending time with others and getting to know them, and have a knack for making people happy, even in the most frustrating situations. A good challenge is always appreciated by Entertainer personalities, and they make wonderful and inspiring counselors, social workers, personal coaches, and consultants who improve employee or customer satisfaction.</p>

<p>With their ability to respond with resourcefulness and passion when their help is badly needed, Entertainers make brilliant medical professionals, especially as EMTs, paramedics, and nurses. They quickly pick up information about others, helping them get straight to the heart of the issue when dealing with the sick or injured. Entertainers thrive on intense emotion, and there’s hardly a better place for it.</p>

<p>Not everybody has the energy for that though, or wants the responsibility of life and death – some Entertainers prefer to make people happy and excited by creating beauty instead. People with this personality type have plenty of creative energy, and many build fulfilling careers in music, fashion, photography, and interior design. With the best aesthetic sense of any personality type, Entertainers are renowned for their sense of style.</p>

<h2>A Touch of Chaos</h2>

<p>However, jobs that eliminate human contact and focus on impartial, data-driven decisions are torturous to Entertainers. Some Entertainer personalities do well enough by blowing off steam with friends after work, but for the most part, careers like technical writing or data analysis are poor fits. Add Entertainers’ loathing for schedules, structures, and repetition, and nine-to-five administrative work is quickly sent to the “nope” bin.</p>

<p>Regardless of where their diverse passions lie, Entertainers need freedom, novelty, and above all, human contact. People with the Entertainer personality type need to know that they aren’t just appreciated, though that is very important, but liked. When Entertainers come in to work, they want to see a touch of chaos, and to navigate it with a crack team of capable friends who are all too happy to take action by their sides.</p>

    <h1>    Conclusion
</h1>


        <p>Few personality types are as charming and attractive as Entertainers. Known for their ability to improvise and focus completely on the present, Entertainers are great at finding exciting new things to explore and experience. Entertainers’ energy, enthusiasm and down-to-earth attitude are invaluable in many areas, including their own personal growth.</p>

</div>

<p>Yet Entertainers can be easily tripped up in situations where their focus on practical matters is more of a liability than an asset. Whether it is finding (or keeping) a partner, reaching dazzling heights on the career ladder, or learning to plan ahead, Entertainers need to put in a conscious effort to develop their weaker traits and additional skills.</p>

<p>What you have read so far is just an introduction into the complex concept that is the Entertainer personality type. You may have muttered to yourself, “wow, this is so accurate it’s a little creepy” or “finally, someone understands me!” You may have even asked “how do they know more about me than the people I’m closest to?”</p>

<p>This is not a trick. You felt understood because you were. We’ve studied how Entertainers think and what they need to reach their full potential. And no, we did not spy on you – many of the challenges you’ve faced and will face in the future have been overcome by other Entertainers. You simply need to learn how they succeeded.</p>

<p>But in order to do that, you need to have a plan, a personal roadmap. The best car in the world will not take you to the right place if you do not know where you want to go. We have told you how Entertainers tend to behave in certain circumstances and what their key strengths and weaknesses are. Now we need to go much deeper into your personality type and answer “why?”, “how?” and “what if?”</p>

<p>This knowledge is only the beginning of a lifelong journey. Are you ready to learn why Entertainers act in the way they do? What motivates and inspires you? What you are afraid of and what you secretly dream about? How you can unlock your true, exceptional potential?</p>

<p>Our premium profiles provide a roadmap towards a happier, more successful, and more versatile YOU! They are not for everyone though – you need to be willing and able to challenge yourself, to go beyond the obvious, to imagine and follow your own path instead of just going with the flow. If you want to take the reins into your own hands, we are here to help you.</p>

</h1>


                        <div class="definition">
                            <p class="title">Who is An Executive (ESTJ)?</p>
                            <p>An <dfn>Executive (ESTJ)</dfn> is someone with the <a class="link--inline" href="/articles/mind-introverted-vs-extraverted">Extraverted</a>, <a class="link--inline" href="/articles/energy-intuitive-vs-observant">Observant</a>, <a class="link--inline" href="/articles/nature-thinking-vs-feeling">Thinking</a>, and <a class="link--inline" href="/articles/tactics-judging-vs-prospecting">Judging</a> personality traits. They possess great fortitude, emphatically following their own sensible judgment. They often serve as a stabilizing force among others, able to offer solid direction amid adversity.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Executives are representatives of tradition and order, utilizing their understanding of what is right, wrong and socially acceptable to bring families and communities together. Embracing the values of honesty, dedication and dignity, people with the Executive personality type are valued for their clear advice and guidance, and they happily lead the way on difficult paths. Taking pride in bringing people together, Executives often take on roles as community organizers, working hard to bring everyone together in celebration of cherished local events, or in defense of the traditional values that hold families and communities together.</p>

</div>

<h2>Leading by Example</h2>

<p>Demand for such leadership is high in democratic societies, and forming no less than 11% of the population, it’s no wonder that many of America’s presidents have been Executives. Strong believers in the rule of law and authority that must be earned, Executive personalities lead by example, demonstrating dedication and purposeful honesty, and an utter rejection of laziness and cheating, especially in work. If anyone declares hard, manual work to be an excellent way to build character, it is Executives.</p>

<p>Executives are aware of their surroundings and live in a world of clear, verifiable facts – the surety of their knowledge means that even against heavy resistance, they stick to their principles and push an unclouded vision of what is and is not acceptable. Their opinions aren’t just empty talk either, as Executives are more than willing to dive into the most challenging projects, improving action plans and sorting details along the way, making even the most complicated tasks seem easy and approachable.</p>

<p>However, Executives don’t work alone, and they expect their reliability and work ethic to be reciprocated – people with this personality type meet their promises, and if partners or subordinates jeopardize them through incompetence or laziness, or worse still, dishonesty, they do not hesitate to show their wrath. This can earn them a reputation for inflexibility, a trait shared by all Sentinel personalities, but it’s not because Executives are arbitrarily stubborn, but because they truly believe that these values are what make society work.</p>

<h2>A Greater Responsibility</h2>

<div class="description-pullout">Executives are classic images of the model citizen: they help their neighbors, uphold the law, and try to make sure that everyone participates in the communities and organizations they hold so dear.</div>

<p>The main challenge for Executives is to recognize that not everyone follows the same path or contributes in the same way. A true leader recognizes the strength of the individual, as well as that of the group, and helps bring those individuals’ ideas to the table. That way, Executives really do have all the facts, and are able to lead the charge in directions that work for everyone.</p>

    <h1>    Strengths &amp; Weaknesses
</h1>


        <h2>Executive Strengths</h2>

<div class="scene">
<img alt="Executive (ESTJ) strengths" src="https://static.neris-assets.com/images/personality-types/scenes/sentinels_Executive_ESTJ_strengths.svg" alt="Executive (ESTJ) strengths">
</div>

<ul>
<li><strong>Dedicated</strong> – Seeing things to completion borders on an ethical obligation for Executives. Tasks aren’t simply abandoned because they’ve become difficult or boring – people with the Executive personality type take them up when they are the right thing to do, and they will be finished so long as they remain the right thing to do.</li>
<li><strong>Strong-willed</strong> – A strong will makes this dedication possible, and Executives don’t give up their beliefs because of simple opposition. Executives defend their ideas and principles relentlessly, and must be proven clearly and conclusively wrong for their stance to budge.</li>
<li><strong>Direct and Honest</strong> – Executives trust facts far more than abstract ideas or opinions. Straightforward statements and information are king, and Executive personalities return the honesty (whether it’s wanted or not).</li>
<li><strong>Loyal, Patient and Reliable</strong> – Executives work to exemplify truthfulness and reliability, considering stability and security very important. When Executives say they’ll do something, they keep their word, making them very responsible members of their families, companies and communities.</li>
<li><strong>Enjoy Creating Order</strong> – Chaos makes things unpredictable, and unpredictable things can’t be trusted when they are needed most – with this in mind, Executives strive to create order and security in their environments by establishing rules, structures and clear roles.</li>
<li><strong>Excellent Organizers</strong> – This commitment to truth and clear standards makes Executives capable and confident leaders. People with this personality type have no problem distributing tasks and responsibilities to others fairly and objectively, making them excellent administrators.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Executive Weaknesses</h2>

<div class="scene">
<img alt="Executive (ESTJ) weaknesses" src="https://static.neris-assets.com/images/personality-types/scenes/sentinels_Executive_ESTJ_weaknesses.svg" alt="Executive (ESTJ) weaknesses">
</div>

<ul>
<li><strong>Inflexible and Stubborn</strong> – The problem with being so fixated on what works is that Executives too often dismiss what <em>might</em> work better. Everything is opinion until proven, and Executive personalities are reluctant to trust an opinion long enough for it to have that chance.</li>
<li><strong>Uncomfortable with Unconventional Situations</strong> – Executives are strong adherents to tradition and when suddenly forced to try unvetted solutions, they become uncomfortable and stressed. New ideas suggest that their methods weren’t good enough, and abandoning what has always worked before in favor of something that may yet fail risks their image of reliability.</li>
<li><strong>Judgmental</strong> – Executives have strong convictions about what is right, wrong, and socially acceptable. Executives’ compulsion to create order often extends to all things and everyone, ignoring the possibility that there are two right ways to get things done. Executives do not hesitate to let these “deviants” know what they think, considering it their duty to set things right.</li>
<li><strong>Too Focused on Social Status</strong> – Executives take pride in the respect of their friends, colleagues and community and while difficult to admit, are very concerned with public opinion. Executives (especially Turbulent ones) can get so caught up in meeting others’ expectations that they fail to address their own needs.</li>
<li><strong>Difficult to Relax</strong> – This need for respect fosters a need to maintain their dignity, which can make it difficult to cut loose and relax for risk of looking the fool, even in good fun.</li>
<li><strong>Difficulty Expressing Emotion</strong> – This is all evidence of Executives’ greatest weakness: expressing emotions and feeling empathy. People with the Executive personality type get so caught up in the facts and most effective methods that they forget to think of what makes others happy, or of their sensitivity. A detour can be breathtakingly beautiful, a joy for the family, but Executives may only see the consequence of arriving at their destination an hour late, hurting their loved ones by rejecting the notion too harshly.</li>
</ul>

    <h1>    Career Paths
</h1>


        <p>Executives’ career paths are often as clear and straightforward as they are themselves. Though there are many directions they can choose to go, people with the Executive personality type almost always end up in situations where they have the opportunity to exercise their affinity for organization, structure, and follow-through. Providing further focus, Executives share a profound respect for tradition, stability and security, qualities which lend themselves well to progressing along clear paths to increased responsibility and dependability.</p>

<div class="scene">
<img alt="Executive (ESTJ) careers" src="https://static.neris-assets.com/images/personality-types/scenes/sentinels_Executive_ESTJ_career_path.svg">
</div>

<p>Executives’ sense of loyalty results in them staying with a single employer as long as possible, and their reverence for established institutions often leads to work with well-respected organizations. Law enforcement, military service, hospitals and prominent legal firms are all able to recognize Executives’ long years of service.</p>

<div class="description-pullout">Executive personalities rise to the occasion and meet their obligations with enviable consistency, making them clear choices for advancement.</div>

<p>Executives are the image of the model citizen, and they strive to maintain this ideal throughout their careers. This helps them move forward into management as well – people with this personality type have many traits inherent to leadership, something that is often recognized regardless of their chosen industry. From the genuine enjoyment Executives feel in organizing other people to their knack for clearly expressing their principles, values and expectations, Executives are extremely effective managers.</p>

<p>Also fearsome leaders, Executives loathe disorganization, ineptitude, laziness and especially dishonesty, and when these values are crossed, Executive personalities do not hesitate to let their disapproval show. So long as everyone plays by the rules, Executives are incredibly efficient, their love of structure and thoroughness leaving a record of accurate, complete work that is on time and on budget. Executives are natural auditors, financial officers and business administrators, and any such and similar roles are excellent choices for them.</p>

<h2>The Value of Hard Work</h2>

<p>Hard work and self-motivation are also strong Executive principles, which makes them excellent sales representatives, whether in basic retail positions, part of office teams, or as independent agents. People with the Executive personality type stick to projects until they’re finished, big or small, and are organized enough to make any necessary paperwork a mere minor inconvenience to their clients, rather than some baffling ordeal. These qualities combine to make the clear steps in advancement that Executives require in order to maintain a sense of accomplishment not just viable, but almost inevitable.</p>

                            <p class="title">Who is An Entrepreneur (ESTP)?</p>
                            <p>An <dfn>Entrepreneur (ESTP)</dfn> is someone with the <a class="link--inline" href="/articles/mind-introverted-vs-extraverted">Extraverted</a>, <a class="link--inline" href="/articles/energy-intuitive-vs-observant">Observant</a>, <a class="link--inline" href="/articles/nature-thinking-vs-feeling">Thinking</a>, and <a class="link--inline" href="/articles/tactics-judging-vs-prospecting">Prospecting</a> personality traits. They tend to be energetic and action-oriented, deftly navigating whatever is in front of them. They love uncovering life’s opportunities, whether socializing with others or in more personal pursuits.</p>

    <p>Life is either a daring adventure or nothing at all.</p>
    <footer>Helen Keller</footer>
</blockquote>

<p>Entrepreneurs always have an impact on their immediate surroundings – the best way to spot them at a party is to look for the whirling eddy of people flitting about them as they move from group to group. Laughing and entertaining with a blunt and earthy humor, Entrepreneur personalities love to be the center of attention. If an audience member is asked to come on stage, Entrepreneurs volunteer – or volunteer a shy friend.</p>

<p>Theory, abstract concepts and plodding discussions about global issues and their implications don’t keep Entrepreneurs interested for long. Entrepreneurs keep their conversation energetic, with a good dose of intelligence, but they like to talk about what is – or better yet, to just go out and do it. Entrepreneurs leap before they look, fixing their mistakes as they go, rather than sitting idle, preparing contingencies and escape clauses.</p>

<h2>Diving Right In</h2>

<p>Entrepreneurs are the likeliest personality type to make a lifestyle of risky behavior. They live in the moment and dive into the action – they are the eye of the storm. People with the Entrepreneur personality type enjoy drama, passion, and pleasure, not for emotional thrills, but because it’s so stimulating to their logical minds. They are forced to make critical decisions based on factual, immediate reality in a process of rapid-fire rational stimulus response.</p>

<p>This makes school and other highly organized environments a challenge for Entrepreneurs. It certainly isn’t because they aren’t smart, and they can do well, but the regimented, lecturing approach of formal education is just so far from the hands-on learning that Entrepreneurs enjoy. It takes a great deal of maturity to see this process as a necessary means to an end, something that creates more exciting opportunities.</p>

<p>Also challenging is that to Entrepreneurs, it makes more sense to use their own moral compass than someone else’s. Rules were made to be broken. This is a sentiment few high school instructors or corporate supervisors are likely to share, and can earn Entrepreneur personalities a certain reputation. But if they minimize the trouble-making, harness their energy, and focus through the boring stuff, Entrepreneurs are a force to be reckoned with.</p>

<h2>The Path Less Traveled</h2>

<p>With perhaps the most perceptive, unfiltered view of any type, Entrepreneurs have a unique skill in noticing small changes. Whether a shift in facial expression, a new clothing style, or a broken habit, people with this personality type pick up on hidden thoughts and motives where most types would be lucky to pick up anything specific at all. Entrepreneurs use these observations immediately, calling out the change and asking questions, often with little regard for sensitivity. Entrepreneurs should remember that not everyone wants their secrets and decisions broadcast.</p>

<div class="description-pullout">Sometimes Entrepreneurs’ instantaneous observation and action is just what’s required, as in some corporate environments, and especially in emergencies.</div>

<p>If Entrepreneurs aren’t careful though, they may get too caught in the moment, take things too far, and run roughshod over more sensitive people, or forget to take care of their own health and safety. Making up only four percent of the population, there are just enough Entrepreneurs out there to keep things spicy and competitive, and not so many as to cause a systemic risk.</p>

<p>Entrepreneurs are full of passion and energy, complemented by a rational, if sometimes distracted, mind. Inspiring, convincing and colorful, they are natural group leaders, pulling everyone along the path less traveled, bringing life and excitement everywhere they go. Putting these qualities to a constructive and rewarding end is Entrepreneurs’ true challenge.</p>

    <h1>    Strengths &amp; Weaknesses
</h1>


        <h2>Entrepreneur Strengths</h2>

<div class="scene">
<img alt="Entrepreneur (ESTP) strengths" src="https://static.neris-assets.com/images/personality-types/scenes/explorers_Entrepreneur_ESTP_strengths.svg" alt="Entrepreneur (ESTP) strengths">
</div>

<ul>
<li><strong>Bold</strong> – People with the Entrepreneur personality type are full of life and energy. There is no greater joy for Entrepreneurs than pushing boundaries and discovering and using new things and ideas.</li>
<li><strong>Rational and Practical</strong> – Entrepreneurs love knowledge and philosophy, but not for their own sake. What’s fun for Entrepreneur personalities is finding ideas that are actionable and drilling into the details so they can put them to use. If a discussion is completely arbitrary, there are better uses for Entrepreneurs’ time.</li>
<li><strong>Original</strong> – Combining their boldness and practicality, Entrepreneurs love to experiment with new ideas and solutions. They put things together in ways no one else would think to.</li>
<li><strong>Perceptive</strong> – This originality is helped by Entrepreneurs’ ability to notice when things change – and when they need to change! Small shifts in habits and appearances stick out to Entrepreneurs, and they use these observations to help create connections with others.</li>
<li><strong>Direct</strong> – This perceptive skill isn’t used for mind games – Entrepreneurs prefer to communicate clearly, with direct and factual questions and answers. Things are what they are.</li>
<li><strong>Sociable</strong> – All these qualities pull together to make a natural group leader in Entrepreneurs. This isn’t something that they actively seek – people with this personality type just have a knack for making excellent use of social interactions and networking opportunities.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Entrepreneur Weaknesses</h2>

<div class="scene">
<img alt="Entrepreneur (ESTP) weaknesses" src="https://static.neris-assets.com/images/personality-types/scenes/explorers_Entrepreneur_ESTP_weaknesses.svg" alt="Entrepreneur (ESTP) weaknesses">
</div>

<ul>
<li><strong>Insensitive</strong> – Feelings and emotions come second to facts and “reality” for Entrepreneurs. Emotionally charged situations are awkward, uncomfortable affairs, and Entrepreneurs’ blunt honesty doesn’t help here. These personalities often have a lot of trouble acknowledging and expressing their own feelings as well.</li>
<li><strong>Impatient</strong> – Entrepreneurs move at their own pace to keep themselves excited. Slowing down because someone else “doesn’t get it” or having to stay focused on a single detail for too long is extremely challenging for Entrepreneurs.</li>
<li><strong>Risk-prone</strong> – This impatience can lead Entrepreneurs to push into uncharted territory without thinking of the long-term consequences. Entrepreneur personalities sometimes intentionally combat boredom with extra risk.</li>
<li><strong>Unstructured</strong> – Entrepreneurs see an opportunity – to fix a problem, to advance, to have fun – and seize the moment, often ignoring rules and social expectations in the process. This may get things done, but it can create unexpected social fallout.</li>
<li><strong>May Miss the Bigger Picture</strong> – Living in the moment can cause Entrepreneurs to miss the forest for the trees. People with this personality type love to solve problems here and now, perhaps too much. All parts of a project can be perfect, but the project will still fail if those parts do not fit together.</li>
<li><strong>Defiant</strong> – Entrepreneurs won’t be boxed in. Repetition, hardline rules, sitting quietly while they are lectured at – this isn’t how Entrepreneurs live their lives. They are action-oriented and hands-on. Environments like school and much entry-level work can be so tedious that they’re intolerable, requiring extraordinary effort from Entrepreneurs to stay focused long enough to get to freer positions.</li>
</ul>

    <h1>    Career Paths
</h1>


        <p>When it comes to Entrepreneurs’ career options, “action” is the word of the day. People with the Entrepreneur personality type think on their feet and are great at making quick decisions in the heat of the moment. At the same time, they’re affable people who always seem to make friends and connections wherever they go. Popularity and solid networking can be huge assets in the working world, and Entrepreneurs nail it.</p>

<div class="scene">
<img alt="Entrepreneur (ESTP) careers" src="https://static.neris-assets.com/images/personality-types/scenes/explorers_Entrepreneur_ESTP_career_path.svg" alt="Entrepreneur (ESTP) careers">
</div>

<p>This social intelligence, combined with Entrepreneurs’ natural boldness and improvisational skill, makes sales, business negotiations, marketing, even acting – any tense, competitive environment – a great fit. Entrepreneur personalities trust themselves to make the right call. Risks, big and small, are a part of life, and Entrepreneurs don’t sit around waiting for some boss at the top to tell them what to do. This can get Entrepreneurs into trouble, but often enough it’s exactly what’s needed, and can boost them up the career ladder just as well.</p>

<div class="description-pullout">It’s hard to imagine Entrepreneurs choosing secure but boring jobs over less stable but more exciting careers.</div>

<p>Restrictions, rules, highly structured environments – these are great ways to drive Entrepreneurs crazy. People with this personality type live life on their own terms, and this makes them brilliant business people and freelancers. These roles also allow them to delegate the more tedious aspects of work, the accounting, meticulous research and so forth, to those better suited.</p>

<p>Entrepreneurs are curious, energetic people with a taste for action. There are those who analyze and manage the logistics of public safety resource distribution, and there are those who drive the ambulances, patrol the streets, and save lives with their own two hands – Entrepreneur personalities are the latter. They are highly observant yet impatient, enabling them to take in the whole of a situation at a glance, and act. Any emergency response role is great for Entrepreneurs, whether it be as paramedics, police officers, or soldiers.</p>

<h2>The Thrill of the Game</h2>

<p>This quality of living in the moment and craving immediate results for their efforts translates well into another field: sports. The thrill of competition, of pushing themselves to the physical limit to rack up just one more point for the win can have no comparison for Entrepreneurs. Whether they are on the field as athletes themselves, coaching from the sidelines or commentating from high above, people with the Entrepreneur personality type revel in well-honed team effort and a well-executed plan, and any of these positions makes a fine line of work for them.</p>

    <h1>    Conclusion
</h1>


        <p>Few personality types are as charming and attractive as Entrepreneurs. Known for their ability to improvise and focus completely on the present, Entrepreneurs are great at finding exciting new things to explore and experience. Entrepreneurs’ creativity and down-to-earth attitude are invaluable in many areas, including their own personal growth.</p>

<div class="scene">

</div>

<p>Yet Entrepreneurs can be easily tripped up in situations where their focus on practical matters is more of a liability than an asset. Whether it is finding (or keeping) a partner, reaching dazzling heights on the career ladder, or learning to plan ahead, Entrepreneurs need to put in a conscious effort to develop their weaker traits and additional skills.</p>

<p>What you have read so far is just an introduction into the complex concept that is the Entrepreneur personality type. You may have muttered to yourself, “wow, this is so accurate it’s a little creepy” or “finally, someone understands me!” You may have even asked “how do they know more about me than the people I’m closest to?”</p>

<p>This is not a trick. You felt understood because you were. We’ve studied how Entrepreneurs think and what they need to reach their full potential. And no, we did not spy on you – many of the challenges you’ve faced and will face in the future have been overcome by other Entrepreneurs. You simply need to learn how they succeeded.</p>

<p>But in order to do that, you need to have a plan, a personal roadmap. The best car in the world will not take you to the right place if you do not know where you want to go. We have told you how Entrepreneurs tend to behave in certain circumstances and what their key strengths and weaknesses are. Now we need to go much deeper into your personality type and answer “why?”, “how?” and “what if?”</p>

<p>This knowledge is only the beginning of a lifelong journey. Are you ready to learn why Entrepreneurs act in the way they do? What motivates and inspires you? What you are afraid of and what you secretly dream about? How you can unlock your true, exceptional potential?</p>

<p>Our premium profiles provide a roadmap towards a happier, more successful, and more versatile YOU. They are not for everyone though – you need to be willing and able to challenge yourself, to go beyond the obvious, to imagine and follow your own path instead of just going with the flow.

                    <h1>    Introduction
</h1>


                        <div class="definition">
                            <p class="title">Who is An Advocate (INFJ)?</p>
                            <p>An <dfn>Advocate (INFJ)</dfn> is someone with the <a class="link--inline" href="/articles/mind-introverted-vs-extraverted">Introverted</a>, <a class="link--inline" href="/articles/energy-intuitive-vs-observant">Intuitive</a>, <a class="link--inline" href="/articles/nature-thinking-vs-feeling">Feeling</a>, and <a class="link--inline" href="/articles/tactics-judging-vs-prospecting">Judging</a> personality traits. They tend to approach life with deep thoughtfulness and imagination. Their inner vision, personal values, and a quiet, principled version of humanism guide them in all things.</p>
                        </div>


                        <blockquote><p>“Treat people as if they were what they ought to be and you help them to become what they are capable of being.”</p> <footer>Johann Wolfgang Von Goethe</footer></blockquote>

<p>Advocates (INFJs) may be the rarest personality type of all, but they certainly leave their mark on the world. Idealistic and principled, they aren’t content to coast through life – they want to stand up and make a difference. For Advocate personalities, success doesn’t come from money or status but from seeking fulfillment, helping others, and being a force for good in the world.</p>

<p>While they have lofty goals and ambitions, Advocates shouldn’t be mistaken for idle dreamers. People with this personality type care about integrity, and they’re rarely satisfied until they’ve done what they know to be right. Conscientious to the core, they move through life with a clear sense of their values, and they aim never to lose sight of what truly matters – not according to other people or society at large, but according to their own wisdom and intuition.</p>

<div class="scene"><img alt="Advocate (INFJ) personality" src="https://static.neris-assets.com/images/personality-types/scenes/diplomats_Advocate_INFJ_introduction.svg"></div>

<h2>Seeking Purpose</h2>

<p>Perhaps because their personality type is so uncommon, Advocates tend to carry around a sense – whether conscious or not – of being different from most people. With their rich inner lives and their deep, abiding desire to find their life purpose, they don’t always fit in with those around them. This isn’t to say that Advocates can’t enjoy social acceptance or close relationships – only that they sometimes feel misunderstood or at odds with the world.</p>

<p>Fortunately, this sense of being out of step doesn’t diminish Advocates’ commitment to making the world a better place. Advocates are troubled by injustice, and they typically care more about altruism than personal gain. They often feel called to use their strengths – including creativity, imagination, and sensitivity – to uplift others and spread compassion.</p>

<div class="description-pullout">Nothing lights up Advocates like changing someone else’s life for the better.</div>

<p>Many Advocates see helping others as their mission in life, and they’re always looking for ways to step in and speak up for what is right. People with this personality type also aspire to fix society’s deeper problems, in the hope that unfairness and hardship can become things of the past. At times, however, Advocates may focus so intently on their ideals that they don’t take adequate care of themselves – a pattern that can lead to stress and burnout.</p>

<h2>Connecting with Others (and Themselves)</h2>

<p>Advocates may be Introverted, but they value deep, authentic relationships with others. Few things bring these personalities as much joy as truly knowing another person – and being known in return. Advocates enjoy meaningful conversations far more than small talk, and they tend to communicate in a way that is warm and sensitive. This emotional honesty and insight can make a powerful impression on the people around them.</p>

<div class="description-pullout">A few close relationships, provided that they’re genuine, can fill Advocates’ hearts to the brim.</div>

<p>Thoughtful and compassionate, Advocates pour a great deal of energy and care into their relationships. This doesn’t mean that they always feel appreciated in return. Advocates tend to act with great thought and care, and it can frustrate them when other people don’t recognize their good intentions. As a result, even constructive criticism may feel incredibly personal or hurtful to these personalities.</p>

<h2>A Personal Mission</h2>

<p>Many Advocates feel that their life has a unique purpose – a mission that they were put onto this earth to fulfill. For people with this personality type, one of the most rewarding aspects of life is seeking out this purpose – and then, once they’ve found it, striving to do it justice.</p>

<p>When Advocates encounter inequity or unfairness, they rarely give up – instead, they consult their intuition and their compassion to find a solution. With their innate ability to balance the heart with the head, Advocates are hardwired to right the wrongs of the world, no matter how big or small. These personalities just need to remember that while they’re busy taking care of everyone else, they need to pause sometimes and take care of themselves as well.</p>

    <h1>    Strengths &amp; Weaknesses
</h1>


        <h2>Advocate (INFJ) Strengths</h2>

<div class="scene"><img alt="Advocate (INFJ) strengths" src="https://static.neris-assets.com/images/personality-types/scenes/diplomats_Advocate_INFJ_strengths.svg"></div>

<ul>

<li><strong>Creative</strong> – Advocates aren’t exactly like everyone else – and that’s a wonderful thing. People with this personality type embrace their creative side, always on the lookout for opportunities to express themselves and think outside the box.</li>

<li><strong>Insightful</strong> – These personalities know all too well that appearances can be misleading. Advocates strive to move beyond superficiality and seek out the deeper truths in life. This can give them an almost uncanny ability to understand people’s true motivations, feelings, and needs.</li>

<li><strong>Principled</strong> – Advocates tend to have strong beliefs and values, particularly when it comes to matters of ethics. When Advocates talk about topics close to their heart, their conviction and heartfelt idealism can inspire and persuade even the sternest of skeptics.</li>

<li><strong>Passionate</strong> – Advocates crave a sense of purpose in life. Rather than living on autopilot or sticking to the status quo, they want to chase after their ideals. This isn’t a personality type that shies away from big dreams – in fact, Advocates are energized and impassioned by the beauty of their visions for the future.</li>

<li><strong>Altruistic</strong> – People with this personality type aren’t happy to succeed at another person’s expense. Advocates want to use their strengths for the greater good, and they rarely lose sight of how their words and actions might affect others. In their heart of hearts, they want to make the world a better place, starting with the people around them.</li>

</ul>

<h2>Advocate (INFJ) Weaknesses</h2>

<div class="scene"><img alt="Advocate (INFJ) weaknesses" src="https://static.neris-assets.com/images/personality-types/scenes/diplomats_Advocate_INFJ_weaknesses.svg"></div>

<ul>

<li><strong>Sensitive to Criticism</strong> – Advocates aren’t averse to feedback – that is, unless they believe that someone is challenging their most cherished principles or values. When it comes to the issues that are near and dear to them, people with this personality type can become defensive or dismissive.</li>

<li><strong>Reluctant to Open Up</strong> – Advocates value honesty and authenticity, but they’re also private. They may find it difficult to open up and be vulnerable about their struggles, not wanting to burden someone else with their issues. Unfortunately, when Advocates don’t ask for help, they may inadvertently hold themselves back or create distance in their relationships.</li>

<li><strong>Perfectionistic</strong> – The Advocate personality type is all but defined by idealism. While this is a wonderful quality in many ways, it doesn’t always leave room for the messiness of real life. Advocates might find it difficult to appreciate their jobs, living situations, or relationships if they’re continually fixating on imperfections and wondering whether they should be looking for something better.</li>

<li><strong>Avoiding the Ordinary</strong> – Advocates yearn to do extraordinary things with their lives. But it’s hard to achieve anything extraordinary without breaking it down into small, manageable steps. Unless they translate their dreams into everyday routines and to-do lists, Advocates may struggle to turn their grand visions into reality.</li>

<li><strong>Prone to Burnout</strong> – Advocates’ perfectionism and reserve leave them with few options for letting off steam. People with this personality type can exhaust themselves if they don’t balance their drive to help others with necessary self-care and rest.</li>

</ul>

    <h1>    Career Paths
</h1>


        <blockquote><p>“It’s better to fail while striving for something wonderful, challenging, adventurous, and uncertain than to say, ‘I don’t want to try because I may not succeed completely.’”</p> <footer>Jimmy Carter</footer></blockquote>

<p>Advocates (INFJs) long to find a career that aligns with their values and their dreams – a career that allows them to fulfill their unique mission in this world. For these personalities, a job isn’t satisfying if it doesn’t offer a deeper sense of purpose – no matter how good the salary is. The good news is that people with this personality type can use their creativity and determination to find work that suits their needs in just about any field.</p>

<p>In fact, Advocates have trouble deciding which job is best for them because they’re able to imagine so many possibilities. They may see half a dozen wildly different paths forward, each with its own set of rewards. This can be exciting but also stress-inducing, because picking just one means letting go of so many others. Advocates may even feel a sense of loss when so many doors close because one was selected.</p>

<h2>The Search for Purpose</h2>

<p>For Advocate personalities, jobs that involve helping and connecting with people can be deeply satisfying. It’s no surprise, then, that many Advocates gravitate toward work as counselors, therapists, psychologists, social workers, teachers, yoga instructors, and spiritual leaders. They may enjoy service industry positions that allow them to interact directly and build genuine relationships with their customers. Careers in health care can also be rewarding options, including occupations such as nursing, physical or occupational therapy, medicine, nutrition, or more holistic paths such as acupuncture.</p>

<div class="scene"><img alt="Advocate (INFJ) careers" src="https://static.neris-assets.com/images/personality-types/scenes/diplomats_Advocate_INFJ_career_path.svg"></div>

<p>Many Advocates are passionate communicators. This explains why they are often drawn to careers in writing, creating many popular books, blogs, stories, video games, and screenplays. For people with this personality type, the opportunity to tell stories for a living can be nothing short of a dream come true. Other Advocates might pursue music, photography, design, illustration, or fine art. Even if these artistic pursuits aren’t their primary job, many Advocates find that creative side hustles offer a much-needed outlet for the themes and ideas that occupy their imaginations.</p>

<p>Nonprofit workplaces, from museums to nature centers to food pantries, also hold a special appeal. With their focus on serving the community rather than drawing a profit, these organizations can be a natural fit for Advocate personalities. But even in workplaces that are very much for-profit, Advocates can find ways to direct their energy and creativity toward helping others. No matter what it says on their business cards, Advocates’ insight can enable them to spot unusual patterns and come up with outside-the-box solutions, creating real change in others’ lives.</p>

<h2>A Sense of Mission</h2>

<p>Advocates are incredibly versatile, but some work environments may rub them the wrong way. This is especially true of workplaces that offer little independence or agency, forcing employees to adhere to rigid, repetitive protocols without regard for their individual needs or strengths. People with this personality type may also chafe at the criticism and pressure that come with cutthroat, competitive work environments.</p>

<p>For this reason, many Advocates seek out more flexible, autonomous positions – or branch off altogether to start their own businesses. They may also find it gratifying to create bridges between seemingly disparate professional fields – for example, by writing about psychology or by being an environmental lawyer. Such hybrid careers can offer plenty of opportunities for Advocates to exercise their creativity and their love of learning.</p>

<div class="description-pullout">
Advocates tend to feel stifled unless their work allows them the freedom to act according to their conscience, their creativity, and their own common sense.
</div>

<p>In truth, Advocate personalities can do well in any field. To be truly happy, however, they need to find work that aligns with their values and allows them some independence. Advocates crave opportunities to learn and grow alongside the people they are helping. When this happens, Advocates may finally feel that they are fulfilling their life’s mission, contributing to the well-being of humanity on a personal level.</p>

                    <h1>    Introduction
</h1>


                        <div class="definition">
                            <p class="title">Who is A Mediator (INFP)?</p>
                            <p>A <dfn>Mediator (INFP)</dfn> is someone who possesses the <a href="/articles/mind-introverted-vs-extraverted" class="link--inline">Introverted</a>, <a href="/articles/energy-intuitive-vs-observant" class="link--inline">Intuitive</a>, <a href="/articles/nature-thinking-vs-feeling" class="link--inline">Feeling</a>, and <a href="/articles/tactics-judging-vs-prospecting" class="link--inline">Prospecting</a> personality traits. These rare personality types tend to be quiet, open-minded, and imaginative, and they apply a caring and creative approach to everything they do.</p>
                        </div>


                        <p>Although they may seem quiet or unassuming, Mediators (INFPs) have vibrant, passionate inner lives. Creative and imaginative, they happily lose themselves in daydreams, inventing all sorts of stories and conversations in their minds. These personalities are known for their sensitivity – Mediators can have profound emotional responses to music, art, nature, and the people around them.</p>
<p>Idealistic and empathetic, Mediators long for deep, soulful relationships, and they feel called to help others. But because this personality type makes up such a small portion of the population, Mediators may sometimes feel lonely or invisible, adrift in a world that doesn’t seem to appreciate the traits that make them unique.</p>

</div>
<h2>The Gift of Empathy<br></h2>
<p>Mediators share a sincere curiosity about the depths of human nature. Introspective to the core, they’re exquisitely attuned to their own thoughts and feelings, but they yearn to understand the people around them as well. Mediators are compassionate and nonjudgmental, always willing to hear another person’s story. When someone opens up to them or turns to them for comfort, they feel honored to listen and be of help.</p>
<div class="description-pullout">For Mediators, an ideal relationship of any kind is one in which both people feel comfortable sharing not just their wildest hopes and dreams but also their secret fears and vulnerabilities.</div><p>Empathy is among this personality type’s greatest gifts, but at times it can be a liability. The troubles of the world weigh heavily on Mediators’ shoulders, and these personalities can be vulnerable to internalizing other people’s negative moods or mindsets. Unless they learn to set boundaries, Mediators may feel overwhelmed by just how many wrongs there are that need to be set right.<br></p>
<h2>Speaking Their Truth</h2>
<p>Few things make Mediators more uneasy than pretending to be someone they aren’t. With their sensitivity and their commitment to authenticity, people with this personality type tend to crave opportunities for creative self-expression. It comes as no surprise, then, that many famous Mediators are poets, writers, actors, and artists. They can’t help but muse about the meaning and purpose of life, dreaming up all sorts of stories, ideas, and possibilities along the way.</p>
<div class="description-pullout">Mediators have a talent for self-expression. They may reveal their innermost thoughts and secrets through metaphors and fictional characters.</div><p>Through these imaginative landscapes, Mediators can explore their own inner nature as well as their place in the world. While this is a beautiful trait, these personalities sometimes show a tendency to daydream and fantasize rather than take action. To avoid feeling frustrated, unfulfilled, or incapable, Mediators need to make sure that they take steps to turn their dreams and ideas into reality.<br></p>
<h2>In Search of a Calling</h2>
<p>People with this personality type tend to feel directionless or stuck until they connect with a sense of purpose for their lives. For many Mediators, this purpose has something to do with uplifting others and their ability to feel other people’s suffering as if it were their own. While Mediators want to help everyone, they need to focus their energy and efforts – otherwise, they can end up exhausted.</p>
<p>Fortunately, like flowers in the spring, Mediators’ creativity and idealism can bloom even after the darkest of seasons. Although they know the world will never be perfect, Mediators still care about making it better however they can. This quiet belief in doing the right thing may explain why these personalities so often inspire compassion, kindness, and beauty wherever they go.</p>

    <h1>    Strengths &amp; Weaknesses
</h1>


        <h2>Mediator (INFP) Strengths</h2>
<div class="scene"><img alt="Mediator (INFP) strengths" src="https://static.neris-assets.com/images/personality-types/scenes/diplomats_Mediator_INFP_strengths.svg"></div>
<ul><li><strong>Empathetic </strong>– Mediators don’t just care about other people in an abstract sense. These personalities can actually feel another person’s emotions, from joy and elation to sorrow and regret. Because of this sensitivity, Mediators tend to be thoughtful and kindhearted, and they hate the idea of hurting anyone, even unintentionally.</li><li><strong>Generous </strong>– Mediators rarely enjoy succeeding at other people’s expense. They feel called to share the good things in their lives, give credit where it’s due, and uplift the people around them. These personalities want to contribute to a world where every voice is heard and no one’s needs go unmet.</li><li><strong>Open-Minded</strong> – Tolerant and accepting, Mediators try not to judge anyone else’s beliefs, lifestyles, or decisions. This is a personality type that prefers compassion to fault-finding, and many Mediators feel empathy even for those who have done wrong. Because they’re so accepting, Mediators often become confidants for their friends and loved ones – and occasionally for total strangers.</li><li><strong>Creative </strong>– Mediators love to see things from unconventional perspectives. Few things give them more pleasure than allowing their minds to wander through all sorts of ideas and possibilities and daydreams. It’s no wonder, then, that many Mediators are drawn to creative pursuits – or that this personality type is well represented among writers and artists.</li><li><strong>Passionate</strong> – When an idea or movement captures their imagination, Mediators want to give their whole heart to it. People with this personality type may not always be outspoken, but that doesn’t diminish their strong feelings for a cause that speaks to their beliefs and convictions.</li><li><strong>Idealistic </strong>– Mediators strive to follow their conscience, even when doing the right thing isn’t easy or convenient. They rarely lose sight of their desire to live a meaningful, purpose-filled life – one that helps others and leaves the world a better place.</li></ul>
<h2>Mediator (INFP) Weaknesses</h2>
<div class="scene"><img alt="Mediator (INFP) weaknesses" src="https://static.neris-assets.com/images/personality-types/scenes/diplomats_Mediator_INFP_weaknesses.svg"></div>
<ul><li><strong>Unrealistic </strong>– Nothing in this world is perfect – and that can be a difficult truth for Mediators to accept. People with this personality type can be hopeless romantics, with rose-colored visions of what their lives should be like. This can set Mediators up for disappointment when reality inevitably falls short of their dreams.</li><li><strong>Self-Isolating</strong> – Mediators long to connect with others, but they don’t always know how. Especially in new environments, Mediators may be reluctant to put themselves out there in ways that would help them make new friends or become involved in a new community. As a result, people with this personality type may sometimes feel lonely or isolated.</li><li><strong>Unfocused </strong>– Mediators’ imaginative, introspective nature doesn’t always lend itself to productivity. Many Mediators get frustrated by how difficult they find it to buckle down and get things done. The problem isn’t that they are incapable – rather, it’s that they run into problems when they become so caught up in different ideas and ideals that they fail to commit to a course of action.</li><li><strong>Emotionally Vulnerable</strong> – The emotional attunement of these personalities is among their greatest strengths. But unless Mediators establish boundaries, they can be at risk of absorbing other people’s negative moods or attitudes.</li><li><strong>Desperate to Please</strong> – Conflict tends to be stressful for Mediators, who yearn for harmony and acceptance. When someone dislikes or disapproves of them, these personalities may become fixated on trying to clear the air and change that person’s mind. Unfortunately, Mediators’ desire to please others can drain their energy, eclipsing their inner wisdom and their awareness of their own needs.</li><li><strong>Self-Critical</strong> – Mediators believe in their unique potential, and they desperately want to live up to it. But this can cause them to have unrealistic expectations for themselves. When Mediators fail to live up to these visions, they may accuse themselves of being useless or selfish or woefully inadequate. Taken too far, this self-criticism can discourage Mediators, leading them to give up on even their dearest dreams.</li></ul><div class="description-pullout">Feeling self-critical right now? Before going to the next section, scroll up to reread your strengths – and let them serve as a reminder of how much you, dear Mediator, can bring to this world.</div>

    <h1>    Career Paths
</h1>


        <p>Many Mediators (INFPs) long for a career that doesn’t just take care of the bills but also feels fulfilling. They want to spend their days doing something they genuinely love, preferably without too much stress or drama.</p>
<div class="description-pullout">For Mediators, an ideal career path should feel like a calling, not just a job. And if it doesn’t involve too many draining social interactions or phone calls, so much the better.</div><p>Ever the idealists, Mediators might struggle to find a profession that meets their practical needs <em>and</em> fulfills their dreams. These personalities may drift in frustration, waiting for the perfect job to present itself and eventually feeling stuck or worried that they’re not living up to their potential.</p>
<div class="scene"><img alt="Mediator (INFP) careers" src="https://static.neris-assets.com/images/personality-types/scenes/diplomats_Mediator_INFP_career_path.svg"></div>
<p>Alas, there’s no such thing as a perfect job, and the question of whether to settle for a less-than-ideal position can weigh heavily on people with this personality type. Fortunately, Mediators’ creativity, independence, and sincere desire to connect with and help others can help them shine – and find fulfillment – in nearly any line of work.</p>
<h2>A Place for Everyone</h2>
<p>Certain careers and vocations seem to hold a special allure for these personalities. With their curiosity and their love of self-expression, many Mediators dream of becoming writers. They might write novels, seek out interesting freelance niches, or even find themselves doing communications in a corporate field or for a nonprofit organization. Richly imaginative, Mediators can infuse even the driest of fundraising or marketing materials with new life.</p>
<div class="description-pullout">Sensitive to artistic beauty, some Mediators simply come to life in the worlds of writing, music, drama, or dance.</div><p>Although this personality type isn’t known for seeking the spotlight, other Mediators find their life purpose in the performing arts. These Mediators can draw from their inner depths to pull out exquisite interpretations of a creator’s work. They may also create their own works as playwrights, composers, or choreographers.</p>
<p>Whatever they do, Mediators want to feel that their work is helping others. It’s not surprising, then, that many people with this personality type choose careers that are focused on service, such as counseling, psychology, teaching, health care, social work, massage therapy, or physical rehabilitation. For these caring, supportive personalities, few things are more meaningful than seeing their work help change someone’s life for the better.</p>
<h2>Finding Their Way</h2>
<p>Mediators are adaptable, but they may find it demotivating to work in high-stress, bureaucratic, or hectic environments. They can also become frustrated by workplaces that are highly critical or competitive. Workplaces that reward independence tend to be a good fit for Mediators, although they may appreciate some structure and oversight to help them avoid procrastinating and getting lost in thought.</p>
<p>That said, Mediators don’t need ideal conditions to thrive professionally. These personalities want to live in tune with their values, in their careers as much as in any other aspect of their lives. They can put up with – and overcome – any number of challenges as they pursue a sense of mission in their work.</p>

    <h1>    Conclusion
</h1>


        <p>Few personality types are as poetic and kindhearted as Mediators (INFPs). With their unique gifts, Mediators can overcome all sorts of challenges and obstacles – <em>and</em> brighten the lives of those around them in the process.</p>
<div class="description-pullout">Mediators’ creativity, imagination, and kindness prove to be invaluable in many areas, including their own personal growth.</div>
<p>Yet Mediators can be tripped up in areas where idealism and altruism are more of a liability than an asset. When it comes to finding (or keeping) a partner, making friends, pursuing a meaningful career, or planning for the future, people with this personality type may need to consciously develop their weaker traits and gain new skills – even as they draw on their many strengths.</p>

                            <p class="title">Who is An Architect (INTJ)?</p>
                            <p>An <dfn>Architect (INTJ)</dfn> is a person with the <a class="link--inline" href="/articles/mind-introverted-vs-extraverted">Introverted</a>, <a class="link--inline" href="/articles/energy-intuitive-vs-observant">Intuitive</a>, <a class="link--inline" href="/articles/nature-thinking-vs-feeling">Thinking</a>, and <a class="link--inline" href="/articles/tactics-judging-vs-prospecting">Judging</a> personality traits. These thoughtful tacticians love perfecting the details of life, applying creativity and rationality to everything they do. Their inner world is often a private, complex one.</p>

<p>It can be lonely at the top. As one of the rarest personality types – and one of the most capable – Architects (INTJs) know this all too well. Rational and quick-witted, Architects pride themselves on their ability to think for themselves, not to mention their uncanny knack for seeing right through phoniness and hypocrisy. But because their minds are never at rest, Architects may struggle to find people who can keep up with their nonstop analysis of everything around them.</p>

</div>

<h2>A Pioneering Spirit</h2>

<p>Architects question everything. Many personality types trust the status quo, relying on conventional wisdom and other people’s expertise to guide their lives. But ever-skeptical Architects prefer to make their own discoveries. In their quest to find better ways of doing things, they aren’t afraid to break the rules or risk disapproval – in fact, they rather enjoy it.</p>

<p>But as anyone with this personality type would tell you, a new idea isn’t worth anything unless it actually works. Architects want to be successful, not just inventive. They bring a single-minded drive to their work, applying the full force of their insight, logic, and willpower. And heaven help anyone who tries to slow them down by enforcing pointless rules or offering poorly thought-out criticism.</p>

<div class="description-pullout">
	Architects, independent to the core, want to shake off other people’s expectations and pursue their own ideas.
</div>

<p>This personality type comes with a strong independent streak. Architects don’t mind acting alone, perhaps because they don’t like waiting around for others to catch up with them. They also generally prefer making decisions without asking for anyone else’s input. At times, this lone-wolf behavior can come across as insensitive, as it fails to take into consideration other people’s thoughts, desires, and plans.</p>

<p>It would be a mistake, however, to view Architects as uncaring. Whatever the stereotypes about their stoic intellect, these personalities feel deeply. When things go wrong or when they hurt others, Architects are personally affected and spend much time and energy trying to figure out why things happened the way that they did. They may not always value emotion as a decision-making tool, but they are authentically human.</p>

<h2>A Thirst for Knowledge</h2>

<p>Architects can be both the boldest of dreamers and the bitterest of pessimists. They believe that, through willpower and intelligence, they can achieve even the most challenging goals. But these personalities may be cynical about human nature more generally, assuming that most people are lazy, unimaginative, or simply doomed to mediocrity.</p>

<p>People with the Architect personality type derive much of their self-esteem from their knowledge and mental acuity. In school, they may have been called “bookworms” or “nerds.” But rather than taking these labels as insults, many Architects embrace them. They recognize their own ability to teach themselves about – and master – any topic that interests them, whether that’s coding or capoeira or classical music.</p>

<div class="description-pullout">
	Architects don’t just learn new things for show – they genuinely enjoy expanding the limits of their knowledge.
</div>

<p>Architects can be single-minded, with little patience for frivolity, distractions, or idle gossip. That said, they’re far from dull or humorless. Many Architects are known for their irreverent wit, and beneath their serious exteriors, they often have a sharp, delightfully sarcastic sense of humor.</p>

<h2>Social Frustrations</h2>

<p>Architects aren’t known for being warm and fuzzy. They tend to prioritize rationality and success over politeness and pleasantries – in other words, they’d rather be right than popular. This may explain why so many fictional villains are modeled on this personality type.</p>

<p>Because Architects value truth and depth, many common social practices – from small talk to white lies – may seem pointless or downright stupid to them. As a result, they may inadvertently come across as rude or even offensive when they’re only trying to be honest.</p>

<div class="description-pullout">
	At times, Architects may wonder whether dealing with other people is even worth the frustration.
</div>

<p>But like any personality type, Architects do crave social interaction – they’d just prefer to surround themselves with people who share their values and priorities. Often, they can achieve this just by being themselves. When Architects pursue their interests, their natural confidence can draw people to them – professionally, socially, and even romantically.</p>

<h2>The Chess Game of Life</h2>

<p>Architects are full of contradictions. They are imaginative yet decisive, ambitious yet private, and curious yet focused. From the outside, these contradictions may seem baffling, but they make perfect sense once you understand the inner workings of the Architect mind.</p>

<p>For these personalities, life is like a giant game of chess. Relying on strategy rather than chance, Architects contemplate the strengths and weaknesses of each move before they make it. And they never lose faith that, with enough ingenuity and insight, they can find a way to win – no matter what challenges might arise along the way.</p>

    <h1>    Strengths &amp; Weaknesses
</h1>


        <h2>Architect (INTJ) Strengths</h2>

<div class="scene"><img alt="Architect (INTJ) strengths" src="https://static.neris-assets.com/images/personality-types/scenes/analysts_Architect_INTJ_strengths.svg"></div>

<ul>

<li><strong>Rational</strong> – Architects pride themselves on the power of their minds. They can reframe nearly any challenge as an opportunity to hone their rational thinking skills and expand their knowledge – and with this mindset, they can devise inventive solutions to even the most arduous of problems.</li>

<li><strong>Informed</strong> – Few personality types are as devoted as Architects to developing rational, correct, and evidence-based opinions. Rather than hunches or half-baked assumptions, they base their conclusions on research and analysis. This gives them the conviction that they need to stand up for their ideas, even in the face of disagreement.</li>

<li><strong>Independent</strong> – For these personalities, conformity is more or less synonymous with mediocrity. Creative and self-motivated, Architects strive to do things their own way. They can imagine few things more frustrating than allowing arbitrary rules or conventions to stand in the way of their success.</li>

<li><strong>Determined</strong> – This personality type is known for being ambitious and goal-oriented. Architects won’t rest until they’ve achieved their own definition of success – which usually entails mastering the subjects and pursuits that matter to them.</li>

<li><strong>Curious</strong> – Architects are open to new ideas – as long as those ideas are rational and evidence-based, that is. Skeptical by nature, Architects are especially drawn to offbeat or contrarian points of view. And if the facts prove them wrong, they are generally happy to revise their opinions.</li>

<li><strong>Original</strong> – Without Architects, the world would be a far less interesting place. This personality type’s rebellious streak is responsible for some of history’s most unconventional ideas and inventions. Even in their everyday lives, Architects force the people around them to consider new (and sometimes startling) ways of looking at things.</li>

</ul>

<h2>Architect (INTJ) Weaknesses</h2>

<div class="scene"><img alt="Architect (INTJ) weaknesses" src="https://static.neris-assets.com/images/personality-types/scenes/analysts_Architect_INTJ_weaknesses.svg"></div>

<ul>

<li><strong>Arrogant</strong> – Architects might be knowledgeable, but they’re not infallible. Their self-assurance can blind them to useful input from other people – especially anyone they deem to be intellectually inferior. These personalities can also come across as needlessly harsh or single-minded in trying to prove others wrong.</li>

<li><strong>Dismissive of Emotions</strong> – For Architects, rationality is king. But emotional context often matters more than people with this personality type care to admit. Architects can get impatient with anyone who seems to value feelings more than facts. Unfortunately, ignoring emotion is its own type of bias – one that can cloud Architects’ judgment.</li>

<li><strong>Overly Critical</strong> – These personalities tend to have a great deal of self-control, particularly when it comes to thoughts and feelings. When the people in their lives fail to match their level of restraint, Architects can appear scathingly critical. But this criticism can be unfair, based on arbitrary standards rather than a full understanding of human nature.</li>

<li><strong>Combative</strong> – Architects hate blindly following <em>anything</em> without understanding why. This includes restrictions and the authority figures who impose them. People with this personality type can get caught up in arguing about useless rules and regulations – but sometimes these battles are distractions from more important matters.</li>

<li><strong>Socially Clueless</strong> – Architects’ relentless rationality can lead to frustration in their social lives. Their efforts to defy expectations may leave them feeling isolated or disconnected from other people. At times, they may become cynical about the value of relationships altogether, questioning the importance of love and connection.</li>

</ul>

    <h1>    Career Paths
</h1>


        <blockquote><p>“One never notices what has been done; one can only see what remains to be done, and if one didn’t like the work, it would be very discouraging.”</p> <footer>MARIE CURIE</footer></blockquote>

<p>Architects (INTJs) are rarely satisfied by work that feels easy or comfortable. They want a career that fires up their curiosity and leverages their intellect, allowing them to expand their prowess as they tackle meaningful challenges and problems. If a job’s description makes the average person think, <em>Wow, that sounds hard</em>, then it might just be a good fit for an Architect.</p>

<div class="scene"><img alt="Architect (INTJ) careers" src="https://static.neris-assets.com/images/personality-types/scenes/analysts_Architect_INTJ_career_path.svg"></div>

<h2>The Early-Career Blues</h2>

<div class="description-pullout">
In the workplace, Architect personalities are often known for competence and effectiveness.
</div>

<p>Starting at the bottom of the career ladder can be frustrating for Architects. Early in their professional lives, they may be saddled with easy, routine tasks that bore them half to death. People with this personality type brim with creative and outside-the-box ideas. But with their disdain for schmoozing and workplace politics, they may struggle to earn the favor of their bosses and colleagues.</p>

<p>The good news is that, over time, many Architects develop their abilities into a track record so good that it can’t be ignored. Even when everyone around them falls prey to groupthink, people with this personality type can cut through the noise and figure out the true cause of a problem – and then fix it. As long as they don’t alienate their coworkers, Architects can advance in their careers and gain the leverage that they need to see their ideas through.</p>

<h2>Finding Their Place</h2>

<p>Some personality types are drawn to jobs that require nonstop teamwork and interaction, but Architects tend to prefer positions that offer independence. By working alone or in small groups, they can make the most of their creativity without constant interruptions from curious coworkers or second-guessing supervisors. Architects really do believe that if they want something done right, they’d better do it themselves.</p>

<div class="description-pullout">
People with this personality type value resourcefulness, grit, insight, and commitment – in themselves and in others.
</div>

<p>The other side of that coin is that Architects have little respect for anyone who gets ahead based on networking or nepotism rather than merit. They believe that everyone should get their work done to the highest possible standards. So if a social butterfly at work breezes through without carrying their own weight, Architects may feel called to use their ingenuity to bring that person back down to earth – or they may be driven to work especially hard to prove their own merit by comparison.</p>

<h2>Ever Greater Challenges</h2>

<p>Architect personalities demand progress and evolution, and they love to explore new ideas. As their careers progress, they may be drawn to positions that allow them to influence a company’s or organization’s overall strategies. Many Architects pursue low-profile but influential roles as project managers, systems engineers, marketing strategists, systems analysts, management consultants, and military strategists.</p>

<p>People with this personality type tend to be happiest in careers that allow them to innovate and experiment in ways both large and small. It’s no surprise, then, that jobs in engineering, research, science, and technology are common choices for Architects. But creative fields, from architecture to musical composition to video game design, can also gratify their innovative streak. And Architects’ relentless desire to get to the bottom of things can lead them to careers as auditors, cybersecurity specialists, or business analysts.</p>

<div class="description-pullout">
Architects view a combination of rational analysis and hard work as the foundation of their success.
</div>

<p>The truth is that Architects can apply their strengths to just about any role. In a retail setting, for example, their insatiable curiosity might lead them to investigate what makes one front-of-store display more effective than another. Some careers with strong social components, such as sales or human resources, might not seem like obvious fits – but fortunately, Architects know how to look beyond the obvious.</p>

<p>Creative and visionary, Architects want to find a career that takes advantage of their unique gifts. Few personality types, if any, can match their ability to transform complex principles into clear, actionable strategies. Architects know how much they can offer the world through their work – and their priority is to ensure that their position, whatever it may be, makes full use of their skills, knowledge, and intellect.</p>

                    <h2>The Path of Discovery</h2>

<p>In reading through this personality profile, you probably hit a tipping point. You went from trademark Architect skepticism to “Huh…” to “Wait, <em>what</em>?” You might even be a little uncomfortable, because you’re not used to being understood, even by the people closest to you.</p>

<p>Chances are you’ve accepted this as part of who you are, and maybe you’ve even grown proud of it. But embracing that disconnect isn’t a requirement for Architects. It’s a misused defense mechanism that can lead you down a lonely, inefficient path. Gaining insight into yourself and others is so much more rewarding – and effective.</p>

<p>At 16Personalities, we’ve spent years researching the patterns, behaviors, and tendencies that shape Architects’ lives. Step by step, insight by insight, we’ve discovered what makes the difference between a successful, fulfilled, energized Architect and an Architect who’s disappointed by life, constantly falling short of their goals and aspirations. This has given us a deep appreciation of the challenges that people with your personality type face – and how those challenges can be overcome.</p>

<p><strong>Our specialized, research-based offerings for Architects can show you how to use your strengths and avoid common pitfalls – while also staying true to who you are.</strong> Because that’s the point, isn’t it? To learn how you can grow into your full potential, in ways that make sense for <em>you</em>.</p>

                            <p class="title">Who is A Logician (INTP)?</p>
                            <p>A <dfn>Logician (INTP)</dfn> is someone with the <a class="link--inline" href="/articles/mind-introverted-vs-extraverted">Introverted</a>, <a class="link--inline" href="/articles/energy-intuitive-vs-observant">Intuitive</a>, <a class="link--inline" href="/articles/nature-thinking-vs-feeling">Thinking</a>, and <a class="link--inline" href="/articles/tactics-judging-vs-prospecting">Prospecting</a> personality traits. These flexible thinkers enjoy taking an unconventional approach to many aspects of life. They often seek out unlikely paths, mixing willingness to experiment with personal creativity.</p>
                        </div>


                        <blockquote><p>The important thing is not to stop questioning. Curiosity has its own reason for existence.</p><footer>ALBERT EINSTEIN</footer></blockquote><p>Logicians pride themselves on their unique perspectives and vigorous intellect. They can’t help but puzzle over the mysteries of the universe – which may explain why some of the most influential philosophers and scientists of all time have been Logicians. This personality type is fairly rare, but with their creativity and inventiveness, Logicians aren’t afraid to stand out from the crowd.</p>
<h2>The Life of the Mind</h2>
<p>Logicians often lose themselves in thought – which isn’t necessarily a bad thing. People with this personality type hardly ever stop thinking. From the moment they wake up, their minds buzz with ideas, questions, and insights. At times, they may even find themselves conducting full-fledged debates in their own heads.</p>
<div class="description-pullout">Imaginative and curious, Logician personalities can find endless fascination in the workings of their own mind.</div><p>From the outside, Logicians may seem to live in a never-ending daydream. They have a reputation for being pensive, detached, and a bit reserved. That is, until they try to train all of their mental energy on the moment or the person at hand, which can be a bit uncomfortable for everyone. But regardless of which mode they’re in, Logicians are Introverts and tend to get tired out by extensive socializing. After a long day, they crave time alone to consult their own thoughts.</p>
<p>But it would be a mistake to think that Logicians are unfriendly or uptight. When they connect with someone who can match their mental energy, these personalities absolutely light up, leaping from one thought to another. Few things energize them like the opportunity to swap ideas or enjoy a lively debate with another curious, inquiring soul.</p>

<h2>Elementary, My Dear Logician</h2>
<p>Logicians love to analyze patterns. Without necessarily knowing how they do it, people with this personality type often have a Sherlock Holmes–like knack for spotting discrepancies and irregularities. In other words, it’s a bad idea to lie to them.</p>
<p>Ironically, Logicians shouldn’t always be held at their word. They rarely mean to be dishonest, but with their active minds, they sometimes overflow with ideas and theories that they haven’t thought through all the way. They may change their mind on anything from their weekend plans to a fundamental moral principle, without ever realizing that they’d appeared to have made up their mind in the first place. In addition, they are often happy to play devil’s advocate in order to keep an interesting discussion humming along.</p>
<div class="description-pullout">For Logicians, the best conversations are like brainstorming sessions, with plenty of room for unconventional thoughts and off-the-wall what-ifs.</div><p>Logicians could spend all day musing about ideas and possibilities – and they often do. That said, the practical, everyday work of turning those ideas into reality doesn’t always hold their interest. Fortunately, when it comes to dissecting a tricky, multilayered problem and coming up with a creative solution, few personality types can match Logicians’ creative genius and potential.</p>
<h2>Mysteries of the Universe</h2>
<p>People with this personality type want to understand everything in the universe, but one area in particular tends to mystify them: human nature. As their name suggests, Logicians feel most at home in the realm of logic and rationality. As a result, they can find themselves baffled by the illogical, irrational ways that feelings and emotions influence people’s behavior – including their own.</p>
<p>This doesn’t mean that Logicians are unfeeling. These personalities generally <em>want</em> to offer emotional support to their friends and loved ones, but they don’t necessarily know how. And because they can’t decide on the best, most efficient way to offer support, they may hold off on doing or saying anything at all.</p>
<p>This “analysis paralysis” can affect multiple areas of Logicians’ lives. People with this personality type can overthink even the smallest of decisions. This makes them feel ineffective and stuck, so exhausted by the endless parade of thoughts in their mind that they struggle to get things done.</p>
<p>The good news is that Logicians don’t have to stay stuck for long. Their unique strengths include everything they need to pull themselves out of the ruts that they occasionally fall into. By leveraging their creativity and their open-mindedness, Logicians can reach their full potential – both as thinkers and as happy, well-rounded people.</p>

    <h1>    Strengths &amp; Weaknesses
</h1>


        <h2>Logician (INTP) Strengths</h2>

<div class="scene">
<img alt="Logician (INTP) strengths" src="https://static.neris-assets.com/images/personality-types/scenes/analysts_Logician_INTP_strengths.svg" alt="Logician (INTP) strengths">
</div>

<ul><li><strong>Analytical </strong>– Logicians analyze everything that they come across, from research data to the behavior of the people around them. This gives them a knack for spotting unexpected patterns and connections that other personality types might overlook.</li><li><strong>Original </strong>– Thanks to their unrelenting imagination, Logicians can come up with creative, counterintuitive ideas that wouldn’t occur to most people. Not all of these ideas are feasible, of course, but Logicians’ willingness to think outside the box can produce remarkable innovations.</li><li><strong>Open-Minded</strong> – Logicians are driven by curiosity and an intense desire to learn everything that they can. People with this personality type tend to be receptive to new ideas and ways of doing things – as long as those ideas are supported by sound reasoning.</li><li><strong>Curious </strong>– These personalities are always casting about for new pursuits, hobbies, and areas of research. One week, they might be obsessed with geophysics, and the next, they might lose themselves in videos about guitar building. When inspiration strikes, Logicians go all in on their newfound interest, learning everything that they can.</li><li><strong>Objective </strong>– Logicians care about the truth. Rather than taking comfort in ideology or received ideas, they want to understand what’s really going on beneath the surface of things. As a result, they can be relied upon to combat bias and misinformation, even when it isn’t easy to do so – and they expect other people to be honest with them in return.</li></ul>
<h2>Logician (INTP) Weaknesses</h2>

<div class="scene">
<img alt="Logician (INTP) weaknesses" src="https://static.neris-assets.com/images/personality-types/scenes/analysts_Logician_INTP_weaknesses.svg" alt="Logician (INTP) weaknesses">
</div>

<ul><li><strong>Disconnected </strong>– Logicians can get lost in their own train of thought, even when they’re with other people. When these personalities finally resurface with something to say, they may find that the conversation has moved on without them. This can cause them to feel disconnected from other people, especially in large social gatherings.</li><li><strong>Insensitive </strong>– People with this personality type see rationality as the key to a better, happier world. At times, they may underestimate the importance of such irrational values as emotion, compassion, etiquette, and tradition. As a result, they may inadvertently come across as insensitive or unkind, even though their intentions are generally good.</li><li><strong>Dissatisfied </strong>– Logicians can’t help but imagine how things could be better than they already are. These personalities are constantly on the lookout for problems to solve, topics to learn, and new ways to approach things. Taken too far, this mindset can become overwhelming, with Logicians constantly trying to reinvent the wheel rather than reliably addressing their needs and responsibilities.</li><li><strong>Impatient </strong>– Logicians take pride in their knowledge and in sharing their ideas. When it comes to explaining their rationale, however, they aren’t always patient. If their conversation partner doesn’t follow along or seem sufficiently interested, Logicians may give up with a dismissive “never mind.”</li><li><strong>Perfectionistic </strong>– Logicians <em>want</em> to get things done, but their quest for perfection can get in the way. At times, these personalities may get so lost in analyzing various options that they never reach a decision. They may also give up on projects that don’t match the ideal vision in their mind.</li></ul>

    <h1>    Career Paths
</h1>


        <p>Freethinking and eccentric, Logicians may struggle to find jobs and career paths that really suit them. Logicians are unusual personalities with unique perspectives on the world, and few work environments are designed with them in mind.</p>
<p>But with a little ingenuity, Logicians can find work that takes full advantage of their strengths – including creativity, a passion for ideas, and an innovative spirit. These qualities, like so many things about this personality type, are rare. As a result, Logicians can – with a little effort – find ways to stand out in a wide range of fields.</p>
<div class="scene">
<img alt="Logician (INTP) personality" src="https://static.neris-assets.com/images/personality-types/scenes/analysts_Logician_INTP_career_path.svg">
</div>
<h2>Called to Explore</h2>
<p>Logicians long for exploration, but not in any conventional way. They find themselves drawn to the realms of theories and ideas, eager to delve beneath the surface of everyday life and investigate the mysteries of the universe.</p>
<div class="description-pullout">For Logician personalities, an ideal workday involves tackling difficult, seemingly unsolvable problems – whether that takes the form of managing a pet store or theorizing about parallel universes.</div><p>With their curious spirits, Logicians can find the beauty in concepts that might make other personality types’ eyes glaze over. Logicians are well represented among mathematicians, analysts, researchers, and scientists, particularly in more abstract fields such as physics. Jobs in engineering and technology can also be a match, especially if they allow room for creativity – Logicians would much rather pioneer new approaches than spend their days implementing someone else’s work.</p>
<p>That said, Logicians needn’t limit themselves to technical fields. Their talent for analysis and research can be invaluable in pretty much any line of work – and Logicians have the flexibility to shine even in careers that might not seem like an obvious match. Any job that allows these personalities to invent or experiment with new processes – from teaching to management to merchandising – can give them endless gratification.</p>
<h2>Deeper Motivations</h2>
<p>At times, Logicians may be difficult for their colleagues to understand. Unlike many personality types, Logicians aren’t motivated by a desire to impress their boss, be accepted by their coworkers, or get a fancy new job title. In fact, they’re often turned off by things that motivate other workers, such as team-building exercises, watercooler chitchat, check-in meetings, or motivational speeches from managers.</p>
<p>Instead, people with this personality type are driven by their own curiosity and their own high standards for themselves. For Logicians, “good enough” is rarely good enough, and they’d hate to be called average or (even worse) mediocre. But they aren’t hardworking just for the sake of it, and not every task captures their attention equally. At times, they might ignore routine or administrative work in favor of pursuits that they consider more engaging or important.</p>
<div class="description-pullout">All Logicians really want is to immerse themselves in an interesting project, and they tend to get annoyed by anything that interrupts this focus.</div><p>Few things frustrate Logicians more than dealing with overbearing bosses or waiting around for other people’s input. As a result, they are often drawn to self-directed workplaces with relatively flat hierarchies. Laboratories can be an excellent match, as can pretty much any environment that allows them to carry out tasks and explore ideas without too many people looking over their shoulder. Alternatively, many Logicians maintain a sense of flexibility and independence by going the self-employed route, offering their services as consultants and freelancers.</p>
<h2>Social Cues</h2>
<p>Nearly every job posting these days requests candidates with <em>strong people skills</em>. Logicians might argue that people skills are overrated – and given how many fields are being revolutionized by data and technology, they may have a point. Increasingly, employers need people like Logicians who can understand complex systems and think critically.</p>
<p>Where Logicians rarely thrive is in workplaces that require them to provide a high degree of emotional satisfaction – working as a cruise-ship massage therapist is probably not their happy place. That said, people with this personality type are nothing if not adaptable, and they can absolutely succeed in service- or people-oriented positions. In these roles, Logicians may need to keep their minds engaged by experimenting with new, more effective ways of serving their customers.</p>
<div class="description-pullout">Logicians may be tempted to steer clear of careers that involve social interaction, but they often find that success in any field requires at least some amount of collaborating with other people.</div><p>If people with this personality type tell themselves that they can’t handle jobs with a social element, then they’re selling themselves short – and needlessly curtailing their options. As long as they manage to smile and shake hands just long enough to prove their skills, Logicians often find that their incisiveness and creativity are in high demand.</p>

    <h1>    Conclusion
</h1>


        <p>What you have read so far is just an introduction to the many complexities of the Logician personality type. Along the way, you may have muttered to yourself, “Wow, this is so accurate, it’s a little creepy,” or “Finally, someone understands me!” You may have even asked, “How do they know more about me than the people I’m closest to do?”</p>
<p>If you feel understood right now, it’s because you are. Years of research have given us deep insights into the unique strengths and challenges of Logicians like you. And that includes the darker aspects of your personality type: the mystery of why other people just don’t seem to get you, the constant frustration at a world that seems tedious and superficial, and the nagging fear that all of your grand ideas might never amount to anything.</p>

<div class="description-pullout">Logicians’ gifts include rationality, innovation, and the ability to envision a better future – but they don’t just want to hear what makes them great.

<p><strong>That’s why we’ve made it our mission to help Logicians like you actually </strong><strong><em>make the most </em></strong><strong>of your strengths. </strong>Learning about your personality type is nothing short of fascinating – especially if you’ve felt misunderstood and underappreciated for most of your life, as many Logicians have. But there’s a deeper purpose to it too.</p>
<p>So here’s our question for you, Logician: Are you ready to unlock your true, exceptional potential? If so, your Premium Profile will give you new insights into your personality, your relationships, your career path, <em>and</em> your life mission (or your many missions, since you’re a Logician). This is the journey of a lifetime – and you’ll find everything you need to get started by moving on to the next section.</p>

                    <h1>    Introduction
</h1>


                        <div class="definition">
                            <p class="title">Who is A Defender (ISFJ)?</p>
                            <p>A <dfn>Defender (ISFJ)</dfn> is someone with the <a class="link--inline" href="/articles/mind-introverted-vs-extraverted">Introverted</a>, <a class="link--inline" href="/articles/energy-intuitive-vs-observant">Observant</a>, <a class="link--inline" href="/articles/nature-thinking-vs-feeling">Feeling</a>, and <a class="link--inline" href="/articles/tactics-judging-vs-prospecting">Judging</a> personality traits. These people tend to be warm and unassuming in their own steady way. They’re efficient and responsible, giving careful attention to practical details in their daily lives.</p>
                        </div>


                        <blockquote>
    <p>Love only grows by sharing. You can only have more for yourself by giving it away to others.</p>
    <footer>Brian Tracy</footer>
</blockquote>

<p>In their unassuming, understated way, Defenders help make the world go round. Hardworking and devoted, people with this personality type feel a deep sense of responsibility to those around them. Defenders can be counted on to meet deadlines, remember birthdays and special occasions, uphold traditions, and shower their loved ones with gestures of care and support. But they rarely demand recognition for all that they do, preferring instead to operate behind the scenes.</p>

<p>This is a capable, can-do personality type, with a wealth of versatile gifts. Though sensitive and caring, Defenders also have excellent analytical abilities and an eye for detail. And despite their reserve, they tend to have well-developed people skills and robust social relationships. Defenders are truly more than the sum of their parts, and their varied strengths shine in even the most ordinary aspects of their daily lives.</p>

<div class="description-pullout">Defenders are true altruists, meeting kindness with kindness-in-excess and engaging with the work and people they believe in with enthusiasm and generosity.</div>

</div>

<h2>The Gift of Loyalty</h2>

<p>Among Defenders’ most distinctive traits is loyalty. Rare is the Defender who allows a friendship or relationship to fade away from lack of effort. Instead, they invest a great deal of energy into maintaining strong connections with their loved ones – and not just by sending “How are you doing?” texts. People with this personality type are known for dropping everything and lending a hand whenever a friend or family member is going through a hard time.</p>

<div class="description-pullout">Defenders tend to feel most energized and effective when they’re showing up for someone who needs their help.</div>

<p>Defenders’ sense of loyalty doesn’t stop with their nearest and dearest – it often extends to their communities, their employers, and even family traditions. But the intensity of their commitment and desire to serve can have its downsides. Other people may take advantage of Defenders’ helpful, hardworking nature, leaving them feeling burned out and overworked. And Defenders may feel guilty or stressed when they contemplate changes – even necessary changes – to themselves, their relationships, or the way they’ve done things in the past.</p>

<h2>The Highest of Standards</h2>

<p>For Defenders, “good enough” is rarely good enough. People with this personality type can be meticulous to the point of perfectionism. They take their responsibilities personally, consistently going above and beyond and doing everything that they can to exceed others’ expectations.</p>

<div class="description-pullout">Defender personalities are known for their humility, and they rarely seek the spotlight.</div>

<p>But what happens when Defenders’ efforts go unnoticed or unappreciated? While Defenders tend to underplay their accomplishments, that doesn’t mean that they don’t enjoy recognition – or that they’re fine with being taken for granted. Unless they learn to stand up for themselves, Defenders may find themselves quietly losing their enthusiasm and motivation, eventually becoming resentful toward the people who just don’t seem to appreciate them.</p>

<h2>Showing Up for Others – and Themselves</h2>

<p>Although they’re Introverted, Defenders have a deeply social nature. Thanks to their ability to remember the details of other people’s lives, Defenders have a special talent for making their friends and acquaintances feel seen, known, and cherished. Few personality types can match Defenders’ ability to choose just the right gift for any occasion, whether large or small.</p>

<p>Dedicated and thoughtful, Defenders find great joy in helping those around them build stable, secure, and happy lives. It may not be easy for people with this personality type to show up for themselves in the way that they show up for other people, but when they do, they often find themselves with even more energy and motivation to do good in the world.</p>

    <h1>    Strengths &amp; Weaknesses
</h1>


        <h2>Defender Strengths</h2>

<div class="scene">
<img alt="Defender (ISFJ) strengths" src="https://static.neris-assets.com/images/personality-types/scenes/sentinels_Defender_ISFJ_strengths.svg" alt="Defender (ISFJ) strengths">
</div>

<ul>
<li><strong>Supportive</strong> – Defenders truly enjoy helping others, and they happily share their knowledge, attention, and expertise with anyone who needs it. People with this personality type strive for win-win situations, choosing teamwork over competition whenever possible.</li>
<li><strong>Reliable</strong> – Rather than working in sporadic, excited bursts that leave things half finished, Defenders are meticulous and careful. They take a steady approach, ensuring that things are done to the highest standard – and often going well beyond what is required.</li>
<li><strong>Observant</strong> – Defender personalities have a talent for noticing things, particularly about other people. They pay attention to the smallest details of what someone says and does, giving them unexpected insights into other people’s lives and emotions.</li>
<li><strong>Enthusiastic</strong> – When the goal is right, Defenders apply all of their gifts to something that they believe will make a real, positive difference in people’s lives – whether that’s fighting poverty with a global initiative or simply making a customer’s day.</li>
<li><strong>Hardworking</strong> – Defenders don’t just get their work done – they take pride in it. People with this personality type often form an emotional attachment to the projects and organizations that they’ve dedicated themselves to, and they won’t rest until they’ve done their share – or more than their share – to be of help.</li>
<li><strong>Good Practical Skills</strong> – This personality type offers the rare combination of an altruistic nature and hard-won practicality. Defenders don’t just <em>hope</em> to help others. They take action – meaning that they’re more than happy to roll up their sleeves and do what’s necessary to care for their friends, family, and anyone else who needs it.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Defender Weaknesses</h2>

<div class="scene">
<img alt="Defender (ISFJ) weaknesses" src="https://static.neris-assets.com/images/personality-types/scenes/sentinels_Defender_ISFJ_weaknesses.svg" alt="Defender (ISFJ) weaknesses">
</div>

<ul>
<li><strong>Overly Humble</strong> – Defenders are so concerned with other people’s feelings that they may refuse to make their thoughts known or to take any duly earned credit for their contributions. And they often downplay their efforts entirely when they think that they could have done some minor aspect of a task better.</li>
<li><strong>Taking Things Personally</strong> – Although they might try to hide it, people with this personality type are deeply sensitive to others’ opinions, and they can be thrown off-balance if someone doesn’t appreciate, approve of, or agree with them. When they encounter criticism or disagreement – even if it’s well intentioned – Defenders may feel as if they’re experiencing a personal attack.</li>
<li><strong>Repressing Their Feelings</strong> – Private and reserved, Defenders tend to internalize their feelings, particularly negative ones. This can create misunderstandings in their relationships. Eventually, all of their repressed feelings and resentments may boil over in a sudden, uncharacteristic outburst of frustration.</li>
<li><strong>Overcommitted</strong> – Defenders’ dutifulness can create situations where they are overwhelmed but unwilling to relax their standards or ask for help. As a result, Defender personalities may suffer silently, trying to do everything themselves, even when it’s simply impossible.</li>
<li><strong>Reluctant to Change</strong> – Defenders are among the personality types that struggle the most with change. Breaking with tradition isn’t easy for Defenders, who place great value on history and precedent. Even when change is necessary, they may wait until the situation reaches a breaking point before altering course.</li>
<li><strong>Too Altruistic</strong> – Defenders’ giving, generous nature can leave them vulnerable to being taken advantage of by others. It can be hard for people with this personality type to rock the boat and stand up to someone who isn’t pulling their own weight.</li>
</ul>

    <h1>    Career Paths
</h1>


        <p>Defenders are often the backbone of their workplace: reliable, hardworking, and always ready to lend a hand. People with this personality type take pride in getting the job done and getting it done well, rarely cutting corners or balking at a time-consuming task. This unshakable work ethic, combined with a genuine desire to be of service to others, makes Defenders invaluable in a range of careers.</p>

<h2>Shining Behind the Scenes</h2>

<p>Few personality types can match Defenders’ deep appreciation of what it means to play a supporting role. Rather than seeking out the spotlight for themselves, Defenders genuinely enjoy helping and uplifting others. It’s no surprise, then, that Defenders tend to seek out workplaces that are collaborative and team-oriented rather than competitive and high pressure.</p>

<div class="scene">
<img alt="Defender (ISFJ) careers" src="https://static.neris-assets.com/images/personality-types/scenes/sentinels_Defender_ISFJ_career_path.svg" alt="Defender (ISFJ) careers">
</div>

<p>With their natural humility, Defender personalities tend to feel especially fulfilled by careers that allow them to facilitate others’ growth, healing, and progress. Teaching is a prime example of this, as are speech therapy, occupational therapy, physical therapy, medicine, and social work. Defenders’ patience and ability to stay present in the moment enable them to be incredibly attuned to the needs of the people they are serving.</p>

<div class="description-pullout">Defenders are motivated, consistent workers, rarely losing sight of the ways in which their daily tasks can benefit others.</div>

<p>No matter what it says on their business card, many Defenders approach their work with an eye toward helping others in practical ways. People with this personality type tend to excel at customer service, with a particular gift for listening to concerns, calming frustrations, and seeing things through to a clear resolution. These skills can also translate well into roles in human resources, IT support, hospitality, retail, office administration, library sciences, and pretty much any job that involves fielding and helping answer people’s questions.</p>

<h2>Never Missing a Beat</h2>

<p>Some personality types lose steam in the face of a tedious, multifaceted task, but not Defenders. Defenders’ attentiveness to detail is among their greatest strengths, and detail-oriented fields like law, accounting, data analysis, and research can be right up their alley. What’s especially notable, however, is how Defenders stay connected to the human dimension of this work, rarely forgetting the impact that their spreadsheets and memos might have on real people.</p>

<div class="description-pullout">Meticulous and socially oriented, Defenders have a talent for remembering things about other people – a talent that can help them connect with a customer, bolster a faltering business relationship, or simply brighten a colleague’s day.</div>

<p>Despite their many gifts, Defender personalities are unlikely to demand recognition or ask for promotions, preferring to let their work speak for itself. Given their respect for tradition and security, Defenders generally have no problem with the idea of moving along in a structured hierarchy, trusting that their bosses will promote them if and when the time is right. But even the most patient Defender can become frustrated if their contributions seem to be continually overlooked. When Defenders do take the leap into management roles, they often find that their strengths are surprisingly well suited to building a cohesive, productive, and effective team.</p>

<p>Defenders can be loyal to a fault, and they may feel guilty at the idea of moving on from their employer – even if it just isn’t working out. But as long as they put themselves in a work environment that appreciates and takes full advantage of their many strengths and talents, Defenders can use their determination, precision, and altruistic energy to do even more good in this world.</p>

</h1>


                        <div class="definition">
                            <p class="title">Who is An Adventurer (ISFP)?</p>
                            <p>An <dfn>Adventurer (ISFP)</dfn> is a person with the <a class="link--inline" href="/articles/mind-introverted-vs-extraverted">Introverted</a>, <a class="link--inline" href="/articles/energy-intuitive-vs-observant">Observant</a>, <a class="link--inline" href="/articles/nature-thinking-vs-feeling">Feeling</a>, and <a class="link--inline" href="/articles/tactics-judging-vs-prospecting">Prospecting</a> personality traits. They tend to have open minds, approaching life, new experiences, and people with grounded warmth. Their ability to stay in the moment helps them uncover exciting potentials.</p>
                        </div>


                        <blockquote>
    <p>I change during the course of a day. I wake and I’m one person, and when I go to sleep I know for certain I’m somebody else.</p>
    <footer>Bob Dylan</footer>
</blockquote>

<p>Adventurers are true artists – although not necessarily in the conventional sense. For this personality type, life itself is a canvas for self-expression. From what they wear to how they spend their free time, Adventurers act in ways that vividly reflect who they are as unique individuals.</p>

<p>And every Adventurer is <em>certainly</em> unique. Driven by curiosity and eager to try new things, people with this personality often have a fascinating array of passions and interests. With their exploratory spirits and their ability to find joy in everyday life, Adventurers can be among the most interesting people you’ll ever meet. The only irony? Unassuming and humble, Adventurers tend to see themselves as “just doing their own thing,” so they may not even realize how remarkable they really are.</p>

<h2>The Beauty of an Open Mind</h2>

<p>Adventurers embrace a flexible, adaptable approach to life. Some personality types thrive on strict schedules and routines – but not Adventurers. Adventurers take each day as it comes, doing what feels right to them in the moment. And they make sure to leave plenty of room in their lives for the unexpected – with the result that many of their most cherished memories are of spontaneous, spur-of-the-moment outings and adventures, whether by themselves or with their loved ones.</p>

<p>This flexible mindset makes Adventurers remarkably tolerant and open-minded. These personalities genuinely love living in a world filled with all kinds of people – even people who disagree with them or choose radically different lifestyles. It’s no surprise, then, that Adventurers are unusually open to changing their minds and rethinking their opinions. If any personality type believes in giving something (or someone) a second chance, it’s Adventurers.</p>

<div class="description-pullout">Adventurers want to live in a world where they – and everyone else – have the freedom to live as they see fit, without judgment.</div>

<p>That said, Adventurers’ go-with-the-flow mentality can have its downsides. People with this personality type may struggle to set long-term plans – let alone stick with them. As a result, Adventurers tend to have a pretty cloudy view of their ability to achieve their goals, and they often worry about letting other people down. Adventurers may find that adding a little structure to their lives goes a long way toward helping them feel more capable and organized – without quashing their independent spirits.</p>

<h2>Living in Harmony</h2>

<p>In their relationships, Adventurers are warm, friendly, and caring, taking wholehearted enjoyment in the company of their nearest and dearest. But make no mistake: this is an Introverted personality type, meaning that Adventurers need dedicated alone time to recharge their energy after socializing with others. This alone time is what allows Adventurers to reestablish a sense of their own identity – in other words, to reconnect with who they truly are.</p>

<div class="description-pullout">Unless they take time for themselves, Adventurers can end up feeling lost in the tide of everyday life, constantly reacting to external circumstances instead of making their own way.</div>

<p>Creative and free-spirited, Adventurers march to the beat of their own drum, and it would be easy to assume that they don’t particularly worry what other people think of them. But this isn’t the case – Adventurers are thoughtful and perceptive, able to pick up on people’s unspoken feelings and opinions, and it can upset them if they don’t feel liked, approved of, or appreciated. When faced with criticism, it can be a challenge for people with this personality type not to get caught up in the heat of the moment. If they encounter harsh or seemingly unfair criticism, they may even lose their tempers in spectacular fashion.</p>

<p>But there’s good news, too: Adventurers live in the present, and they know that they don’t need to dwell on past hurts or frustrations. Rather than focusing on how things could be different, people with this personality type have an incredible capacity for appreciating what’s right about life just as it is. Everywhere they look, Adventurers can find sources of beauty and enjoyment that other people might miss – and this perspective is just one of the many gifts that they share with the world.</p>

    <h1>    Strengths &amp; Weaknesses
</h1>


        <h2>Adventurer Strengths</h2>

<div class="scene">
<img alt="Adventurer (ISFP) strengths" src="https://static.neris-assets.com/images/personality-types/scenes/explorers_Adventurer_ISFP_strengths.svg" alt="Adventurer (ISFP) strengths">
</div>

<ul>
<li><strong>Charming</strong> – People with the Adventurer personality type are relaxed and warm, and their “live and let live” attitude naturally makes them likable and popular. </li>
<li><strong>Sensitive to Others</strong> – Adventurers easily relate to others’ emotions, helping them to establish harmony and good will, and minimize conflict.</li>
<li><strong>Imaginative</strong> – Being so aware of others’ emotions, Adventurer personalities use creativity and insight to craft bold ideas that speak to people’s hearts. While it’s hard to explain this quality on a resume, this vivid imagination and exploratory spirit help Adventurers in unexpected ways.</li>
<li><strong>Passionate</strong> – Beneath Adventurers’ quiet shyness beats an intensely feeling heart. When people with this personality type are caught up in something exciting and interesting, they can leave everything else in the dust.</li>
<li><strong>Curious</strong> – Ideas are well and good, but Adventurers need to see and explore for themselves whether their ideas ring true. Work revolving around the sciences may seem a poor match for their traits, but a boldly artistic and humanistic vision is often exactly what research needs to move forward – if Adventurers are given the freedom they need to do so.</li>
<li><strong>Artistic</strong> – Adventurers are able to show their creativity in tangible ways and with stunning beauty. Whether writing a song, painting an emotion, or presenting a statistic in a graph, Adventurers have a way of visualizing things that resonates with their audience.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Adventurer Weaknesses</h2>

<div class="scene">
<img alt="Adventurer (ISFP) weaknesses" src="https://static.neris-assets.com/images/personality-types/scenes/explorers_Adventurer_ISFP_weaknesses.svg" alt="Adventurer (ISFP) weaknesses">
</div>

<ul>
<li><strong>Fiercely Independent</strong> – Freedom of expression is often Adventurers’ top priority. Anything that interferes with that, like traditions and hard rules, creates a sense of oppression for Adventurer personalities. This can make more rigidly structured academics and work a challenge.</li>
<li><strong>Unpredictable</strong> – Adventurers’ dislike long-term commitments and plans. The tendency to actively avoid planning for the future can cause strain in Adventurers’ romantic relationships and financial hardship later in life.</li>
<li><strong>Easily Stressed</strong> – Adventurers live in the present, full of emotion. When situations get out of control, people with this personality type (especially Turbulent ones) can shut down, losing their characteristic charm and creativity in favor of gnashing teeth.</li>
<li><strong>Overly Competitive</strong> – Adventurers can escalate small things into intense competitions, turning down long-term success in their search for glory in the moment, and are unhappy when they lose.</li>
<li><strong>Fluctuating Self-Esteem</strong> – It’s demanded that skills be quantified, but that’s hard to do with Adventurers’ strengths of sensitivity and artistry. Adventurers’ efforts are often dismissed, a hurtful and damaging blow, especially early in life. Adventurers can start to believe the naysayers without strong support.</li>
</ul>

    <h1>    Career Paths
</h1>


        <p>When it comes to the career world, Adventurers need more than just a job. Wealth, power, structure, advancement and security are all lesser goals to Adventurer personalities’ greatest need: creative freedom. Adventurers crave a tangible outlet for their imagination, a chance to express themselves artistically.</p>

<div class="description-pullout">Those placing their emphasis on predictability and long-term planning find that attempts to push those views on Adventurers are about as effective as forcing open flames to point downwards.</div>

<div class="scene">
<img alt="Adventurer (ISFP) careers" src="https://static.neris-assets.com/images/personality-types/scenes/explorers_Adventurer_ISFP_career_path.svg" alt="Adventurer (ISFP) careers">
</div>

<p>People with the Adventurer personality type are passionate experimenters, and whether they’re aware of it or not, they are renowned trendsetters. With their unique perspective and simple desire to be themselves, Adventurers are natural artists, musicians and photographers, as well as designers of all stripes. Setting up shop on websites like Etsy is far more alluring to Adventurers than the confines of 9-5 administrative work in some fluorescent cubicle.</p>

<h2>Free Spirits at Work</h2>

<p>Adventurers loathe sitting idle in colorless, unchanging environments. They are free souls and need flexibility, opportunities for improvisation, and immersive work that engages every sense. If they combine these needs with their competitive nature, Adventurer personalities make great solo athletes. Adventurers prefer to live in the moment, believing the here and now is what matters most.</p>

<p>This quality does have the drawback of sometimes making Adventurers reckless and shortsighted, though those pitfalls aren’t set in stone. An emphasis on practical, tangible things, objects that can be seen and touched, comes at the cost of ignoring less tangible ideas. Adventurers often feel that they have little control over processes like retirement planning – they can’t predict the future, so it does no good to worry about it now.</p>

<h2>Looking to Tomorrow</h2>

<p>This mindset can hold them back from many of their ideal careers, such as psychology, counseling and teaching, which require long-term planning and often extensive certifications to get started. It takes a great deal of energy for Adventurers to maintain focus on a single goal like that for so long, but it can make the day-to-day so much more rewarding for the rest of their lives.</p>

<p>An easier route revolves around freelance and consulting work in just about any industry that Adventurers enjoy. Whether organizing charity events, working with hospitals to make patients’ stays more pleasant, or laying stone to help make a house a home, Adventurers always seem to find a way to make the world a little more beautiful and exciting, and to make a living in the process.</p>

</div>

<p>Yet Adventurers can be easily tripped up in areas where their focus on practical matters is more of a liability than an asset. Whether it is finding (or keeping) a partner, reaching dazzling heights on the career ladder, or learning to plan ahead, Adventurers need to put in a conscious effort to develop their weaker traits and additional skills.</p>

                    <h1>    Introduction
</h1>


                        <div class="definition">
                            <p class="title">Who is A Logistician (ISTJ)?</p>
                            <p>A <dfn>Logistician (ISTJ)</dfn> is someone with the <a class="link--inline" href="/articles/mind-introverted-vs-extraverted">Introverted</a>, <a class="link--inline" href="/articles/energy-intuitive-vs-observant">Observant</a>, <a class="link--inline" href="/articles/nature-thinking-vs-feeling">Thinking</a>, and <a class="link--inline" href="/articles/tactics-judging-vs-prospecting">Judging</a> personality traits. These people tend to be reserved yet willful, with a rational outlook on life. They compose their actions carefully and carry them out with methodical purpose.</p>
                        </div>


                        <blockquote>
    <p>I’d be more frightened by not using whatever abilities I’d been given. I’d be more frightened by procrastination and laziness.</p>
    <footer>DENZEL WASHINGTON</footer>
</blockquote>

<p>Logisticians pride themselves on their integrity. People with this personality type mean what they say, and when they commit to doing something, they make sure to follow through.</p>

<p>This personality type makes up a good portion of the overall population, and while Logisticians may not be particularly flashy or attention-seeking, they do more than their share to keep society on a sturdy, stable foundation. In their families and their communities, Logisticians often earn respect for their reliability, their practicality, and their ability to stay grounded and logical, even in the most stressful situations.</p>

<div class="scene">
    <img alt="Logistician (ISTJ) personality" src="https://static.neris-assets.com/images/personality-types/scenes/sentinels_Logistician_ISTJ_introduction.svg" alt="Logistician (ISTJ) personality">
</div>

<div class="description-pullout">In a world where many people shirk their responsibilities or say what they think others want to hear, Logisticians stand out as dedicated, responsible, and honest.</div>

<h2>A Life of Integrity</h2>

<p>The core of Logisticians’ self-respect comes from a sense of personal integrity. People with this personality type believe that there is a right way to proceed in any situation – and that anyone who pretends otherwise is probably trying to bend the rules to suit their own purposes. Logisticians have a deep respect for structure and tradition, and they are often drawn to organizations, workplaces, and educational settings that offer clear hierarchies and expectations.</p>

<div class="description-pullout">For many Logisticians, a lack of structure offers not freedom, but chaos.</div>

<p>People with the Logistician personality type rarely hesitate to take responsibility for their actions and choices. Generally speaking, they are quick to own up to their own mistakes, admitting the truth even if it doesn’t make them look good. To Logisticians, honesty is far more important than showmanship, and they’d rather satisfy their own conscience than lie to impress someone else.</p>

<p>Because they strive to meet their obligations no matter what, Logistician personalities are often baffled by people who fail to hold themselves to the same standard. At times, Logisticians might unfairly misjudge people who can’t match their rigorous self-control – suspecting that someone is being lazy or dishonest when that person might actually be coping with other challenges. Even if Logisticians don’t speak these judgments aloud, their disdain can come through regardless, earning them a reputation for being somewhat strict or unempathetic.</p>

<h2>Picking Up the Slack</h2>

<p>Logisticians’ dedication is an admirable quality, and it drives many of their accomplishments. But it can also become a weakness that other people take advantage of. With their strong work ethic and sense of duty, Logisticians may routinely find themselves shouldering other people’s responsibilities. Even if they don’t complain about the situation, Logisticians can end up exhausted or discouraged if they’re constantly expected – or taking it upon themselves – to pick up the slack for their colleagues, friends, or loved ones.</p>

<div class="description-pullout">Logisticians may find themselves doing other people’s work – and not getting credit for it.</div>

<p>Logisticians aren’t known for expressing their emotions readily, but that doesn’t mean that people with this personality type don’t feel frustration or resentment when they’re pulling more than their weight. And unless they make sure that their relationships are balanced and sustainable, Logisticians may end up compromising the very stability that they feel called to protect. The good news is that, by learning to set appropriate boundaries and speak up when they’re overstretched, Logisticians can offer the world the full benefit of their many gifts, including their clarity, their loyalty, and their dependability.</p>

    <h1>    Strengths &amp; Weaknesses
</h1>


        <h2>Logistician Strengths</h2>

<div class="scene">
<img alt="Logistician (ISTJ) strengths" src="https://static.neris-assets.com/images/personality-types/scenes/sentinels_Logistician_ISTJ_strengths.svg" alt="Logistician (ISTJ) strengths">
</div>

<ul>
<li><strong>Honest and Direct</strong> – Integrity is the heart of the Logistician personality type. Emotional manipulation, mind games and reassuring lies all run counter to Logisticians’ preference for managing the reality of the situations they encounter with plain and simple honesty.</li>
<li><strong>Strong-willed and Dutiful</strong> – Logisticians embody that integrity in their actions too, working hard and staying focused on their goals. Patient and determined, people with the Logistician personality type meet their obligations, period.</li>
<li><strong>Very Responsible</strong> – Logisticians’ word is a promise, and a promise means everything. Logisticians would rather run themselves into the ground with extra days and lost sleep than fail to deliver the results they said they would. Loyalty is a strong sentiment for Logistician personalities, and they fulfill their duties to the people and organizations they’ve committed themselves to.</li>
<li><strong>Calm and Practical</strong> – None of their promises would mean much if Logisticians lost their tempers and broke down at every sign of hardship – they keep their feet on the ground and make clear, rational decisions. Peoples’ preferences are a factor to consider in this process, and Logisticians work to make the best use of individual qualities, but these decisions are made with effectiveness in mind more so than empathy. The same applies to criticisms, for others and themselves.</li>
<li><strong>Create and Enforce Order</strong> – The primary goal of any Logistician is to be effective in what they’ve chosen to do, and they believe that this is accomplished best when everyone involved knows exactly what is going on and why. Unclear guidelines and people who break established rules undermine this effort, and are rarely tolerated by Logisticians. Structure and rules foster dependability; chaos creates unforeseen setbacks and missed deadlines.</li>
<li><strong>Jacks-of-all-trades</strong> – Much like Analyst personality types, Logisticians are proud repositories of knowledge, though the emphasis is more on facts and statistics than concepts and underlying principles. This allows Logisticians to apply themselves to a variety of situations, picking up and applying new data and grasping the details of challenging situations as a matter of course.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Logistician Weaknesses</h2>

<div class="scene">
<img alt="Logistician (ISTJ) weaknesses" src="https://static.neris-assets.com/images/personality-types/scenes/sentinels_Logistician_ISTJ_weaknesses.svg" alt="Logistician (ISTJ) weaknesses">
</div>

<ul>
<li><strong>Stubborn</strong> – The facts are the facts, and Logisticians tend to resist any new idea that isn’t supported by them. This factual decision-making process also makes it difficult for people with the Logistician personality type to accept that they were wrong about something – but anyone can miss a detail, even them.</li>
<li><strong>Insensitive</strong> – While not intentionally harsh, Logisticians often hurt more sensitive types’ feelings by the simple mantra that honesty is the best policy. Logistician personalities may take emotions into consideration, but really only so far as to determine the most effective way to say what needs to be said.</li>
<li><strong>Always by the Book</strong> – Logisticians believe that things work best with clearly defined rules, but this makes them reluctant to bend those rules or try new things, even when the downside is minimal. Truly unstructured environments leave Logisticians all but paralyzed.</li>
<li><strong>Judgmental</strong> – Opinions are opinions and facts are facts, and Logisticians are unlikely to respect people who disagree with those facts, or especially those who remain willfully ignorant of them.</li>
<li><strong>Often Unreasonably Blame Themselves</strong> – All this can combine to make Logisticians believe they are the only ones who can see projects through reliably. As they load themselves with extra work and responsibilities, turning away good intentions and helpful ideas, Logisticians sooner or later hit a tipping point where they simply can’t deliver. Since they’ve heaped the responsibility on themselves, Logisticians then believe the responsibility for failure is theirs alone to bear.</li>
</ul>

    <h1>    Career Paths
</h1>


        <p>While many personality types may be comfortable with flexible work as consultants and sole proprietors, Logisticians are much more focused on building long-term, stable careers. That’s not to say that Logisticians can’t do that sort of work – many find themselves thinking about what’s on the other side of those cubical walls – but what they crave is dependability, and that is reflected in their choice of work perhaps more so than in any other part of their lives.</p>

<h2>A Steadfast Mind</h2>

<p>The facts support this, as the most common careers among people with the Logistician personality type revolve around institutions of respected tradition, authority, security, and established consistency. Careers as military officers, lawyers, judges, police officers and detectives are all very popular among Logisticians. This makes sense, as they not only offer the stability that Logisticians seek, but are in line with their principles and conservatism, establishing clear societal roles.</p>

<div class="scene">
<img alt="Logistician (ISTJ) careers" src="https://static.neris-assets.com/images/personality-types/scenes/sentinels_Logistician_ISTJ_career_path.svg" alt="Logistician (ISTJ) careers">
</div>

<p>Logisticians of course aren’t limited to these organizations – there are many other roles that utilize their reliability, objectivity and sharp eyes. When facts and logic are out of place, Logistician personalities swoop in as the accountants, auditors, data analysts, financial managers, business administrators and even doctors that identify, report and correct the issues at hand.</p>

<p>Most of these careers have Logisticians working alone, which is usually their preference, but when teams are necessary, they are best defined by clearly outlined roles, responsibilities and work environments.</p>

<div class="description-pullout">Nothing is quite so challenging for Logisticians as ongoing debates about who is responsible for what, resulting in work that’s shoddily assembled – or worse, incomplete.</div>

<p>Logisticians have strong opinions about how things should be done, and if things are shuffled too often, people with this personality type can become surprisingly vocal about their opposition. It’s important for Logisticians to remember that even the most traditional and stable career paths can and need to change as time goes by. It is much better to accept this with grace than to develop reputations of being enemies of new ideas.</p>

<h2>The Backbone of Society</h2>

<p>Logisticians may also struggle with the increasingly open and social requirements of modern work life. Being somewhat bad at sensing others feelings, Logisticians’ “just the facts” attitude can be downright alienating when it comes to more sensitive personality types. This applies not just to coworkers but to customers as well – service positions like retail sales and waiting tables, as well as more emotionally demanding careers such as psychiatry are, generally speaking, a terrible fit.</p>

<p>The ideal career paths feature a trend: they place facts above feelings and allow Logisticians to uphold the hard standards that are the backbone of society. Rules are the basis for everything people take for granted about modern life, from the social contract that smooths relationships, to the laws that protect peoples’ most basic safety, to the constitutions and treaties that govern nations. People with the Logistician personality type take on roles as the defenders of these ideas, in big ways and small, and are rightfully proud of it.</p>

    <h1>    Conclusion
</h1>


        <p>Few personality types are as practical and dedicated as Logisticians. Known for their reliability and hard work, Logisticians are good at creating and maintaining a secure and stable environment for themselves and their loved ones. Logisticians’ dedication is invaluable in many areas, including their own personal growth.</p>

<div class="scene">
<img alt="Logistician (ISTJ) personality" src="https://static.neris-assets.com/images/personality-types/scenes/sentinels_Logistician_ISTJ_conclusion.svg" alt="Logistician (ISTJ) personality">
</div>

<p>Yet Logisticians can be easily tripped up in areas where their practical and methodical approach are more of a liability than an asset. Whether it is finding (or keeping) a partner, learning to relax or improvise, reaching dazzling heights on the career ladder, or managing their workload, Logisticians need to put in a conscious effort to develop their weaker traits and additional skills.</p>

<p>What you have read so far is just an introduction into the complex concept that is the Logistician personality type. You may have muttered to yourself, “wow, this is so accurate it’s a little creepy” or “finally, someone understands me!” You may have even asked “how do they know more about me than the people I’m closest to?”</p>

<p>This is not a trick. You felt understood because you were. We’ve studied how Logisticians think and what they need to reach their full potential. And no, we did not spy on you – many of the challenges you’ve faced and will face in the future have been overcome by other Logisticians. You simply need to learn how they succeeded.</p>

We have told you how Logisticians tend to behave in certain circumstances and what their key strengths and weaknesses are. Now we need to go much deeper into your personality type and answer “why?”, “how?” and “what if?”</p>

<p>This knowledge is only the beginning of a lifelong journey. Are you ready to learn why Logisticians act in the way they do? What motivates and inspires you? What you are afraid of and what you secretly dream about? How you can unlock your true, exceptional potential?</p>
